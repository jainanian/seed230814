Mature soybean seeds initially are soaked in a liquid comprising a glyphosate herbicide for a period of time sufficient for the herbicide to reach the embryos of the soybean seeds. Following such soaking the soybean seeds are planted to produce at least one soybean plant or a descendant thereof in a subsequent generation that displays resistance to glyphosate herbicide. The existence of the naturally-occurring glyphosate herbicide resistance in a soybean plant is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of a foreign gene for herbicide resistance that has been introduced by genetic engineering. Soybean seeds capable of forming the naturally-occurring genetically-controlled glyphosate herbicide resistance that is not attributable to genetic engineering also are provided. Such herbicide resistance can be reliably expressed and transferred to other soybean plants by conventional plant breeding methods..

cattle,7607405,"A highly automated method and system for providing individual animal electronic identification, measurement and value based management of cattle in a large cattle feedlot.

With this information together with animal physiological characteristics and historical data, the computer system calculates the optimum (c) slaughter weight, (d) economic end point and (e) marketing date for shipment to a packing plant. After measurement, individual animals are (f) sorted by direction of the computer in response to calculations from the measurements.

wheat,7608708,"The present invention relates to monocotyledon plant cells and plants which are genetically modified, wherein the genetic modification consists of the introduction of an extraneous nucleic acid molecule which codes for a protein with the biological activity of an R1 protein. The present invention further relates to means and methods for the production thereof.
