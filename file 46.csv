The present invention also provides a soybean seed with less than about 3.5 weight percent total saturated fatty acids..

beet,7427697,"The present invention relates to isolated genes originating from Beta vulgaris, sugar beet, that are involved in responses to stress situations. The genes were isolated from a sugar beet cDNA library screened in a functional selection procedure with transformed yeast cells that were able to grow in selection medium with high salt concentrations.

date,7447989,"A method and system for creating timed reminders linked to computer-readable documents. The present invention permits a user to create a reminder for any date and time, and associate any data file with the reminder in such a manner that the file is automatically opened, executed, or read as applicable at the date and time specified in the reminder. A document-linked reminder may be created from any application program within an application suite through the use of a reminder creation dialog. The reminder creation dialog permits a user to specify a time and date on which the reminder will activate, and an associated file. The reminder is then stored in a database. The reminder creation dialog may be later accessed in order to create additional reminders, or to edit the time, date, or associated file for existing reminders. Periodically, the document reminder system will poll the database in order to determine whether any reminders need to be activated.

atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form a dielectric layer of hafnium nitride (Hf3N4) and hafnium oxide (HfO2) and a method of fabricating such a combination gate and dielectric layer produces a reliable structure for use in a variety of electronic devices. Forming the dielectric structure includes depositing hafnium oxide using precursor chemicals, followed by depositing hafnium nitride using precursor chemicals, and repeating to form the laminate structure. Alternatively, the hafnium nitride may be deposited first followed by the hafnium nitride. Such a dielectric layer may be used as the gate insulator of a MOSFET, a capacitor dielectric in a DRAM, or a tunnel gate insulator in flash memories, because the high dielectric constant (high-k) of the film provides the functionality of a thinner silicon dioxide film, and because of the reduced leakage current when compared to an electrically equivalent thickness of silicon dioxide..

goat,7527939,"A specific and sensitive in vitro ELISA assay and diagnostic test kit is disclosed for determining levels of NT-proBNP protein in a variety of bodily fluids, non-limiting examples of which are blood, serum, plasma, urine and the like. The NT-proBNP ELISA assay test employs the sandwich ELISA technique to measure circulating NT-proBNP in human plasma. In order to obtain antibodies with specific binding properties for targeted amino acid sequences within human proBNP, recombinant human proBNP (or rhproBNP) was expressed and purified for use as an immunogen.
