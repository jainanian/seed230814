raspberry,PP21185,"A new and distinct floricane fruiting red raspberry, Rubus idaeus L., variety is described. The variety results from selection among a population of seedlings derived from controlled pollination crossing of the raspberry varieties known as ‘Lewis’ (not patented) and selection 86105M57 (not patented). The new variety is distinguished from others by the semi crown-forming nature of the plant which tends to produce fewer thicker canes that tend to branch and are very vigorous. The variety is further distinguished by having fruit that ripen on long laterals, release from the receptacle very easily, are dark in color, have large drupelets, and are very firm. In addition, the plant has displayed some field resistance to root rot caused by Phytophthora fragariae var. rubi and appears to be tolerant to infection of Raspberry Bushy Dwarf Virus (RBDV).
