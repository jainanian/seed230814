corn,9534019,"The present invention provides methods of preparing extracts of material fermented with Paenibacillus sp., preferably Paenibacillus elgii ourofinensis. The extracts exhibit antimicrobial activity and may be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of infections in animals or plants or as a growth promoter in animals intended for slaughter for human consumption.
