date,5375073,"An instrumentation system includes a hand-held computer-based measuring meter having a visual display and a plurality of individual sensor modules that can be selectively coupled to the measuring meter for measuring one of a variety of parameters such as temperature, pressure, or the like. Each sensor module includes a sensor responsive to a particular stimulus, as well as a data memory for storing information about the sensor. When the sensor module is interconnected with the measuring meter, the measuring meter accesses the memory of the sensor module to input data corresponding to sensor type, an accuracy code, calibration point data, and a calibration date code. The measuring meter compares the calibration date code to the current date to determine whether the sensor module requires recalibration. The measuring meter uses the accuracy code data to determine the number of significant digits displayed by the visual display.

tomato,5378819,"Systemin is an 18 amino acid peptide hormone that induces expression of defense genes in plants wounded mechanically or by predators including herbivores, insects, bacteria and viruses. The precursor for systemin is encoded as a 200 amino acid prosystemin molecule that has the systemin peptide sequence located near the carboxy-terminus. Both a 951 bp cDNA for prosystemin and 4526 bp genomic DNA were cloned and the organization of the gene was determined. Transgenic plants constructed with antisense prosystemin DNA fail to mount a defensive response to wounding. Transgenic plants constructed with increased copy number of prosystemin genes exhibit increase resistance to wounding.

date,5381462,A utility meter reading and communications system gathers data from utility meters and sends that data to a utility company's central data collection point (host computer) via phone lines. The system places a call on the user's telephone line at a specified time and date and transmits data using dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) format. The system ensures that users still may use the telephone line by sensing off-hook conditions initiated by a resident's telephone and immediately dropping the line to reestablish dial tone for the residential customer. The system uses a variety of error-detection procedures and communications protocols to ensure a high degree of reliability in communicating data to and from the central office and the utility meter system.

After the polyurethane foam article and the mold are separated, the article is coated with an elastomeric coating, such as an acrylic material that is applied as a liquid. Thus, the inventive articles, including those made in accordance with the inventive process, can be used as three-dimensional hollow novelty items of a variety of shapes. In addition, the inventive articles, such as Halloween pumpkins, are carvable, reusable, and can be used with a light source..

The growth is stopped just before silicon grown layers (22) connect to one another, thus obtaining epitaxially grown layers (22) having regions which are separate from one another. The device is formed in the epitaxially grown layer (22). The silicon grown layer (22) is isolated from the silicon substrate (2) and has the uniform plane bearing, thus allowing no electrostatic capacitance to be caused due to pn junction with the silicon substrate (2) and high-speed operation to be realized. Moreover, the unique plane bearing facilitates control during the manufacturing process..

tobacco,5489980,"An apparatus comprising two light sources, a composite detector, a fixed grating, two independent slits and a mask with a multiplicity of slits analyzes the spectral composition of samples rapidly and accurately and can transmit such information to other locations by modem. A first light source produces a spectrum with broad spectral range, a second light source produces a spectrum with multiple sharp spectral features. The first and second light sources are used to produce a sample spectrum and a reference spectrum respectively. A portion of the light from each of the two sources is used to calibrate the intensity of the instrument at each wavelength measurement. Rapid scanning is achieved by continuous multiplexing of each wavelength of light to the detector using a rotating mask with a multiplicity of slits. Continuous wavelength calibration is achieved by using the reference spectrum to encode a wavelength scale as spectrum is acquired. The spectral data can be transmitted by the said apparatus to other locations by modem. The said modem enables a multiplicity of the said apparatus to be used at various locations to perform a common analysis function. For example, a city wide medical network of analyzers may be set up to communicate with a central data base, where analyses on clinical assays may be performed by powerful dedicated computers.
