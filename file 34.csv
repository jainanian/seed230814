A laser may be used as the heat source. The present invention is advantageously embodied in heat bonded fastenings for sutures or K-wires, in which a variety of different suture anchors are usable, including expandable distal suture anchors. Other embodiments include a metal bone plate which is held to bone by a metal bone screw and a nut of bondable material bonded to the plate to secure the connection; a piece of bondable material bonded to a metal prosthesis to custom fit the prosthesis; and a surgical implant custom formed by bonding together a plurality of discrete elements one or more of which is bondable..

tobacco,5929304,"The invention relates to the production of enzymatically active recombinant human and animal lysosomal enzymes involving construction and expression of recombinant expression constructs comprising coding sequences of human or animal lysosomal enzymes in a plant expression system.

The xynC gene may be used to design probes for use in hybridization experiments to isolate xylanase genes from other anaerobic fungi.

rice,5952553,"Rice plants are disclosed with two separate, but synergistic mechanisms for resistance to herbicides that normally inhibit a plant's acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) enzyme. The herbicide resistance of plants with both resistance mechanisms is substantially greater that one would expect from a simple combination of the two types of resistance.

The second resistance mechanism is a mutant AHAS enzyme, an enzyme that shows direct resistance to levels of herbicide that normally inhibit the enzyme, in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Besides controlling red rice, many AHAS-inhibiting herbicides also effectively control other weeds that are common in rice fields. Several of these herbicides have residual activity, so that a treatment controls both existing weeds as well as weeds that sprout later.

The proteins, which can be characterized as catalysts of the extension of plant cell walls and the weakening of the hydrogen bonds in pure cellulose, are referred to as expansins. Two proteins have been isolated by fractionation techniques from washed wall fragments of cucumber hypocotyls, referred to as ""cucumber expansin-29"" and ""cucumber expansin-30"" (abbreviated cEx-29 and cEx-30, with respect to their apparent relative masses as determined by SDS-PAGE). Moreover, three peptide fragments from the purified cEx-29 protein were sequenced, then oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a portion of the expansin cDNA using polymerase chain reaction with a cDNA template derived from cucumber seedlings, and then the PCR fragment was used to screen a cDNA library to identify full length clones. Another expansin protein has been isolated from oat coleoptiles (oat expansin oEx-29), while three additional expansin sequences have been identified in Arabidopsis and an additional two in rice. Expansins appear to be broadly distributed throughout the plant kingdom and can be identified in stem and leaf vegetables (i.e., broccoli, cabbage), fruit and seed vegetables (i.e., tomato), fiber crops and cereals (i.e., corn), and forest and ornamental crops (i.e., cotton).

The proteins, which can be characterized as catalysts of the extension of plant cell walls and the weakening of the hydrogen bonds in pure cellulose, are referred to as expansins. Two proteins have been isolated by fractionation techniques from washed wall fragments of cucumber hypocotyls, referred to as ""cucumber expansin-29"" and ""cucumber expansin-30"" (abbreviated cEx-29 and cEx-30, with respect to their apparent relative masses as determined by SDS-PAGE). Moreover, three peptide fragments from the purified cEx-29 protein were sequenced, then oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify a portion of the expansin cDNA using polymerase chain reaction with a cDNA template derived from cucumber seedlings, and then the PCR fragment was used to screen a cDNA library to identify full length clones. Another expansin protein has been isolated from oat coleoptiles (oat expansin oEx-29), while three additional expansin sequences have been identified in Arabidopsis and an additional two in rice. Expansins appear to be broadly distributed throughout the plant kingdom and can be identified in stem and leaf vegetables (i.e., broccoli, cabbage), fruit and seed vegetables (i.e., tomato), fiber crops and cereals (i.e., corn), and forest and ornamental crops (i.e., cotton).

soybean,5989915,"A method is disclosed for making more efficient the particle-mediated germ line genetic transformation of bean species such as soybean. After a particle-mediated transformation event, in the absence of a selectable marker gene, relatively large numbers of plants must be regenerated to find the relatively low likelihood germ line transformation events which have occurred. It has been discovered that using in the transformation process a marker gene linked to the gene of interest, and by excising a segment of the stem of the shoot during the regeneration process and assaying the segment for the marker gene, certain patterns or phenotypes can be identified in the stem segment which are associated with an increased frequency of germ line transformation events. As the plants are regenerated, other indices of gene expression, at the first trifoliate leaf stage and at the third or fourth trifoliate leaf stage, also serve as markers of the likelihood of germ line transformation.

alfalfa,5990385,"This invention is directed to characterizing a host system suitable for the production of functional transgenic proteins, such as anti-human IgG, for use in applications requiring Government regulatory approval. It is well known that regulatory agencies required stable, consistent master cell banks and master cell lines for the production of transgenic proteins in order to ensure sufficient material for appropriate characterization, clinical trials, and potential sales. Current plant production systems require the establishment of seed banks for this purpose. However, there are many draw backs related to such a system for the production of a continuous reliable transgenic protein source. An aspect of this invention is directed to characterizing a plant production system suitable for transgenic proteins that meet the stringent regulatory requirements. Another aspect of this invention exemplifies the production and characterization of an anti-human IgG for use as a blood grouping reagents, through the expression of corresponding genes in transgenic alfalfa plants. The cDNAs of the heavy and light chains of a human IgG-specific IgG2a(kappa) murine mAb (C5-1) were transferred into alfalfa through Agrobacterium infection. Transgenic plants expressing the light- and heavy-chain encoding mRNAs were obtained and plants from the F1 progeny (obtained by sexual crossing) were found to express fully assembled C5-1. Furthermore, the transgenic protein was stable in vivo, as well as during extraction and purification procedures. Purification yielded a unique H2L2 form with a reactivity indistinguishable from hybridoma-derived C5-1 in standardized serological tests.

alfalfa,5990385,"This invention is directed to characterizing a host system suitable for the production of functional transgenic proteins, such as anti-human IgG, for use in applications requiring Government regulatory approval. It is well known that regulatory agencies required stable, consistent master cell banks and master cell lines for the production of transgenic proteins in order to ensure sufficient material for appropriate characterization, clinical trials, and potential sales. Current plant production systems require the establishment of seed banks for this purpose. However, there are many draw backs related to such a system for the production of a continuous reliable transgenic protein source.
