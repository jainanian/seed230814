potato,6083687,"A cDNA clone (HEV1) encoding hevein was isolated via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mixed oligonucleotides corresponding to two regions of hevein as primers and a Hevea brasiliensis latex cDNA library as a template. HEV1 is 1018 nucleotides long and includes an open reading frame of 204 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal sequence of 17 amino acid residues followed by a 187 amino acid polypeptide. The amino-terminal region (43 amino acids) is identical to hevein and shows homology to several chitin-binding proteins and to the amino-termini of wound-induced genes in potato and poplar. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the polypeptide (144 amino acids) is 74-79% homologous to the carboxyl-terminal region of wound-inducible genes of potato. Wounding, as well as application of the plant hormones abscisic acid and ethylene, resulted in accumulation of hevein transcripts in leaves, stems and latex, but not in roots, as shown by using the cDNA as a probe.

fig,6084067,"Nucleic acids encoding novel CTLA4/CD28 ligands which costimulate T cell activation are disclosed. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid has a sequence which encodes a B lymphocyte antigen, B7-2. Preferably, the nucleic acid is a DNA molecule comprising at least a portion of a nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 8, SEQ ID NO:1 or FIG. 14, SEQ ID NO:23.

The hypocotyl section of seedlings is co-cultured with Agrobacterium transformant and regenerated by adventitious shoot induction and by root induction, where the Agrobacterium transformant contains an expression vector that comprises the promoter of a fruit-dominant ascorbate oxidase gene, an SOD gene isolated from cassava, and an herbicide-resistant bar gene. The present invention also relates to a method for inducing adventitious shoot from hypocotyl sections in plant tissue culture, thus providing a method for the efficient production of transgenic plants maintaining higher SOD activity in fruits.

cotton,6094898,"A flexible insert for a cotton stripper finger assembly adapted for stripping cotton bolls from cotton plants planted in narrow row or broadcast configuration. The insert comprises a flexible plastic strip sandwiched between a conventional metal stripping finger and a metal hold-down member. The insert has edges extending outwardly from the metal stripping finger edges to reduce the effective width of the gap between fingers to more efficiently strip cotton bolls from cotton plants having relatively thin stalks. The portions of the insert which project beyond the metal stripping finger are sufficiently flexible to permit efficient stripping of cotton plants with thicker stalks. Since the effective gap width can change with changing plant conditions, the need to change gap-adjusting inserts is eliminated.

cotton,6112131,"A gin process control system including sensing stations for sensing the physical properties of cotton as it progresses through a gin. A moisture sensor determines, over a wide range of values, the amount of moisture in the cotton. A quality monitor determines the color of the cotton, color distribution, and the amount and type of trash or other impurities which may be entrained in the cotton. A micronaire unit determines both micronaire and cotton maturity. A fiber length tester provides information on the length distribution, breaking strength, and elongation of the cotton fibers. Cotton samples are gathered from the gin flow stream and presented to the sensing stations in a variety of manual, semi-automated, and automated fashions. In a fully automated unit, the sensing stations are connected directly to the gin. The sensing stations are also in communication with the gin process control system, which uses the data from the sensing stations to automatically control the operation of the gin. Alternately, the sensing stations are assembled into a stand-alone unit. In a semi-automatic version of the stand-alone unit, samples are manually gathered and presented to the unit in cassettes for automated subsampling and testing by the sensing stations. In this semi-automatic version, the sensing stations may be in a configuration identical to that of the fully automatic, on-line unit.

The method of the present invention preferably uses reduced thioredoxin with wheat flour which imparts a stronger dough and higher loaf volumes. Methods for reducing snake, bee and scorpion toxin proteins with a thiol redox (SH) agent and thereby inactivating the protein or detoxifying the protein in an individual are also provided. Protease inhibitors, including the Kunitz and Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitors of soybean, were also reduced by the NADP/thioredoxin system (NADPH, thioredoxin, and NADP-thioredoxin reductase) from either E. coli or wheat germ. When reduced by thioredoxin, the Kunitz and Bowman-Birk soybean trypsin inhibitors lose their ability to inhibit trypsin. Moreover, the reduced form of the inhibitors showed increased susceptibility to heat and proteolysis by either subtilisin or a protease preparation from germinating wheat seeds. The 2S albumin of castor seed endosperm was reduced by thioredoxin from either wheat germ or E. coli. Thioredoxin was reduced by either NADPH and NADP-thioredoxin reductase or dithiothreitol. Analyses showed that thioredoxin actively reduced the intramolecular disulfides of the 2S large subunit, but was ineffective in reducing the intermolecular disulfides that connect the large to the small subunit. A novel cystine containing protein that inhibits pullulanase was isolated. The protein was reduced by thioredoxin and upon reduction its inhibitory activity was destroyed or greatly reduced..

cotton,6146766,"A sodium silicate polymerization method was used to incorporate sodium silicate and/or other water soluble inorganic fire retardants into an insoluble matrix. By using a vacuum/pressure technique, a water soluble sodium silicate/borate mixture was forced into the interior of various cellulosic materials, then was heat polymerized into an insoluble fire retardant matrix. This produced a dual action fire retardant material also with the following properties: moisture resistant, weather proof, and improved strength. Water insoluble forms of sodium silicate and borates have not been possible until now. This process and testing was then repeated with six other water soluble fire retardant combinations, making them similarly water insoluble. The process was used to incorporate water soluble substances into the intercellular structures of cotton fibers, polymerized to the insoluble form in the interior, thus becoming trapped inside the fibers, producing weavable fibers, that were flexible, very strong and highly fire retardant. Because some of the best fire retardants are water soluble inorganic compounds, from both fire retardant and environmental considerations, until now, the problem of water solubility has greatly restricted the widespread use of the water soluble inorganic fire retardants. The present invention provides a very promising approach for solving this problem while providing the added properties of increased strength.
