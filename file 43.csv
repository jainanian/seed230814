legume,7038113,"Soybean and Medicago truncatula CYP93C genes have been isolated which encode a cytochrome P450 that can catalyze the aryl migration of a flavanone to yield an isoflavanone intermediate or an isoflavone. Plants can now be genetically engineered to produce isoflavones that provide potential human health benefits and increase disease resistance in plants. Isoflavones can now be produced in transgenic plants species in which isoflavones do not naturally occur, i.e., in species other than legumes. Alternatively, introducing infection-inducible isoflavonoid biosynthesis into non-legumes qualitatively complements these plants phytoalexin defenses against microbial pathogens, whereas over-expression of the isoflavonoid pathway in legumes quantitatively increases this defense response.

soybean,7135626,Soybean plants are provided that exhibit in the absence of induced mutagenesis naturally-occurring genetically-controlled glyphosate herbicide resistance that is not attributable to genetic engineering. Mature soybean seeds initially are soaked in a liquid comprising a glyphosate herbicide for a period of time sufficient for the herbicide to reach the embryos of the soybean seeds. Following such soaking the soybean seeds are planted to produce at least one soybean plant or a descendant thereof in a subsequent generation that displays resistance to glyphosate herbicide. The existence of the naturally-occurring glyphosate herbicide resistance in a soybean plant is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of a foreign gene for herbicide resistance that has been introduced by genetic engineering. Soybean seeds capable of forming the naturally-occurring genetically-controlled glyphosate herbicide resistance that is not attributable to genetic engineering also are provided. Such herbicide resistance can be reliably expressed and transferred to other soybean plants by conventional plant breeding methods.,2006-11-14,Soybean seeds and plants exhibiting natural herbicide resistance,utility,2006,"Natural Genes, Inc.",11151532,11/151532,NA,48] NA,48189] NA,US] NA,-101.707] NA,34.1848] NA,Plainview] NA,9] NA,NA,NA,inventional,Agriculture; forestry; animal husbandry; hunting; trapping; fishing,New plants or ; non-transgenic;  processes for obtaining them; plant reproduction by tissue culture techniques,A01H,NA,A01H1/04] A01H5/10] A01H6/542,"Processes for modifying genotypes ; ; Plants characterised by associated natural traits;  -Processes of selection ; involving genotypic or phenotypic markers; Methods of using phenotypic markers for selection] Angiosperms, i.e. flowering plants, characterised by their plant parts; Angiosperms characterised otherwise than by their botanic taxonomy-Seeds] Angiosperms, i.e. flowering plants, characterised by their botanic taxonomy-Leguminosae or Fabaceae, e.g. soybean, alfalfa or peanut-Glycine max [soybean]",23008] 1132,149455] 18044,r91i2ghjilhbzrk5fyg9mvznh,1bd5e525dc6d6c609a0df627c2e41893,3,Drgs&Med,33,Genetics,1692,14925,Soybean plants are provided that exhibit in the absence of induced mutagenesis naturally-occurring genetically-controlled glyphosate herbicide resistance that is not attributable to genetic engineering.
