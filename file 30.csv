For a color CRT display system with a single-beam image generator, the image correction system (20) includes RGB pixel color output detectors (22R, 22G, 22B) and an image correction subsystem (24). For each pixel the display image, the RGB detectors (22R, 22G, 22B) detect component color amplitude, providing corresponding detector signals to the image correction subsystem (24). The image correction subsystem corrects pixel color output errors by providing position correction signals to the display's image generator (14), repositioning the image beam within the pixel relative to the constituent RGB color phosphors, and corrects intensity errors by providing an intensity correction signal that adjusts beam current. The image correction method is adaptable to a wide variety of display systems, such as CRT monochrome and color displays, and fixed-position LCD and LED displays. It can operate on a real time basis using feedback of detected pixel output from a display image, or on a sampled basis using stored correction factors calculated from a test image.

lime,5084258,"Sulfur dioxide (SO.sub.2) can be oxidized to rapidly sulfur trioxide (SO.sub.3) in a high temperature environment. It has been found that the SO.sub.2 oxidation rate can be impeded by a high rate of temperature reduction in a dynamic condition such as in a boiler and the ductwork of a power plant and an industrial plant. The mechanism of the reaction kinetics has been developed. With the understanding of the mechanism, the methods for oxidation of SO.sub.2 to form SO.sub.3 have been developed. The SO.sub.3 rich flue gas is treated with lime (CaO) in a fluidized lime reactor wherein SO.sub.3 reacts with CaO to form CaSO.sub.4 coating on the surface of CaO. The high heat generated from the SO.sub.3 /CaO reaction causes the remaining SO.sub.2 to convert in the reactor to SO.sub.3 which in turn reacts with CaO to form more CaSO.sub.4.

It has been found that the SO.sub.2 oxidation rate can be impeded by a high rate of temperature reduction in a dynamic condition such as in a boiler and the ductwork of a power plant and an industrial plant. The mechanism of the reaction kinetics has been developed. With the understanding of the mechanism, the methods for oxidation of SO.sub.2 to form SO.sub.3 have been developed. The SO.sub.3 rich flue gas is treated with lime (CaO) in a fluidized lime reactor wherein SO.sub.3 reacts with CaO to form CaSO.sub.4 coating on the surface of CaO. The high heat generated from the SO.sub.3 /CaO reaction causes the remaining SO.sub.2 to convert in the reactor to SO.sub.3 which in turn reacts with CaO to form more CaSO.sub.4.

cattle,5111799,"Disclosed is an apparatus for estrous detection, analysis and telemetric communication of a signal indicating estrus. The apparatus is specially adapted for surgical implantation on the hindquarters of cattle or other animals which exhibit selective standing heat behavior often termed standing to be mounted. The apparatus which is implanted under the hide of the animal, comprises a self contained power source, a force responsive sensor, a controller, a transmitter, an antenna, and a fluid-tight capsule which surrounds the other elements of the apparatus. The apparatus operates by sensing force applied during sustained mounting of an animal which is in estrus by another animal in the herd. The implantable apparatus analyzes the duration of mounting to discriminate standing heat mountings from shorter duration spurious mountings which routinely occur in cattle herds. The number of standing heat mountings which occur in a fixed period, for example 8 hours, are counted and the frequency is compared to a threshold which determines whether estrus should be indicated by transmitting a telemetric signal from the implanted apparatus. The telemetric signal is broadcast from the subcutaneous location to a receiver and suitable indicator from which the state of estrus can be perceived by the herdsman.

fig,5134274,"A charge-coupled imaging device (FIG. 3) is thinned to allow for backside illumination. The device is further enhanced using ion implantation techniques to establish an electrical field (44) at the back surface, which functions to drive free electrons to potential wells generated beneath a gate structure (40) on the front surface. The device structure allows for both front side and backside illumination and is useful as an imaging device in applications where it is necessary to combine images from two different optical sources. The imaging device is particularly useful in terrestrial guidance systems (FIG. 5) where the imaging device is used to detect guide stars from a large guide star field.

Diamond is good thermal conductor unlike silicon dioxide and a good electrical insulator like silicon dioxide. A high grade, high purity device-quality silicon wafer is chosen. An insulating diamond film of about 0.5 um or any suitable thickness is grown on the whole silicon wafer, including the rim area. A polycrystalline silicon of about 2 microns thick or so is then deposited on the whole wafer, including the rim area. Using the rim area silicon as the seed the polycrystalline silicon crystallizes into a single crystal by a zone melting recrystallization technique. The rim area is scribed off the wafer, leaving a recrystallized silicon-on-diamond (FIG. 1d). The structure top to bottom is recrystallized silicon-diamond and silicon-substrate. The structure is similar to ZMR SOI, but the insulator here is diamond instead of silicon dioxide and is therefore called ZMR SOD.

rice,5248765,"A method for separating phytate and manganese from protein and dietary fiber involves treatment of an aqueous slurry of phytate-containing material at a low pH with insoluble alumina. In a batch treatment process the pH of the solution is increased, leaving phytate units attached to the alumina while freeing the protein and dietary fiber. In a column treatment process, the column containing alumina is rinsed, after the low pH treatment, with dilute acid and water to recover the protein and/or dietary fiber.

beet,5281279,"A process for producing refined sugar directly from plants of cane or beet raw juices which bypasses the traditional manufacturing of an intermediate product called ""raw sugar"". After treatment of the sugar juice with a flocculant, the juice has pressurized air dissolved in it, followed by rapid lowering of the pressure to ambient in a dissolved air flotation cell to separate impurities by aeration. Further amounts of flocculant are added, and the juice is passed through a serpentine flocculator comprising a pipe containing a plurality of relatively straight section interrupted by sharp bends to expose the juice sequentially to different turbulent regimes defined by different ranges of Reynolds numbers to form flocs containing undissolved solids. Flocs and other undissolved solids are separated from the juice by flotation and settling. The sugar juice or liquor is partially evaporated to a concentration between about 45.degree. and 50.degree. Brix to form a syrup, after which the syrup is again contacted with a flocculant. Following further treatment in the serpentine flocculator and dissolved air flotation cell, the remaining syrup is passed through filters such as silica sand, activated carbon and diatomaceous earth. The filtered syrup is contacted with ion exchange resins to decolorize and deash the syrup, and then it is evaporated to a concentration of 62.degree.-64.degree. Brix.

The pearl nucleus is either threaded or configured to provide a tight frictional fit with the peripheral edge of the opening. The pearl nucleus is inserted into the opening and then turned by means of the nut portion to provide a very tight fit in the opening. In another embodiment, a pearl nucleus is drawn into the abalone in the vicinity of the head region, or through an opening formed in the abalone shell, by means of a probe which is introduced into the abalone through another smaller opening. The pearl nucleus is pulled into the abalone until it is seated adjacent the smaller opening, where it is held by tissue pressure and glue. The larger opening drilled in the abalone shell may be closed with an elongate pearl nucleus having a size and shape sufficient to pass through the opening in a first orientation and capable of substantially occluding the opening in a second orientation. In a further alternative embodiment, a pearl nucleus and piece of graft tissue are secured to one end of a curved, elongate probe and threaded through a soft tissue of the abalone to an implanted position.
