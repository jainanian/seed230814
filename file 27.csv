apple,4212683,"An FET comprising as many as three parallel channels having different threshold voltages. The two outer channels can have very low W/L ratios and resulting low drain-to-source currents. In one embodiment, the FET has a central enhancement channel flanked by low W/L ratio, low current, depletion channels. The FET is fabricated by forming an oxide mask (e.g., by etching a window in the gate oxide over the device active area); enhancement implanting the substrate through the window (e.g., n-substrate and n-implant for a p-channel FET); enlarging the window width a predetermined distance by etching; and depletion implanting the substrate through the window (p-implant for n-substrate) to a concentration below that of the enhancement implant. The gate structure is formed over the combined enhancement and depletion channels and a source and a drain span the ends of the channels.

cotton,4229442,"A biochemical process for the aerobic thermophyllic fermentation of cotton gin waste is disclosed which converts a presently useless pest ridden agricultural waste product into a useful medium for the culture of horticultural and agronomic plants as well as microorganisms useful to man. By the aeration, water content and physical shape and size of the waste product, piles are so conditioned that by means of the resulting biodegradation processes plant pathogenic microorganisms, insects, viruses, spider mites and related pests are destroyed. Additionally, pesticidal residues, chemical plant growth regulators and certain harvest aid materials normally added to the growing cotton crop for production purposes are reduced to materials harmless to plant life. The resulting humus like material provides improved plant growth, nearly five times that of a good river loam soil, and contains a microbial population that prevents the spread of soil borne plant pathogenic microorganisms reintroduced into the medium. The aerobic thermophyllically fermented gin waste provides a medium for growing horticultural and other plants without sterilization with heat or the use of fungicides. It also provides a medium with a source of energy for the culture of microorganisms useful to man.

grape,4253390,"A system for extracting liquids from fruit, vegetables, or other similar materials with particular application to dejuicing grapes. The system provides a destemmer for receiving picked grapes and for removing stems and leaves therefrom. The destemmer partially crushes the grapes during the destemming operation producing free run juice in the resulting grape must. The must is transferred to a predrainer screw press which separates and collects the free run juice and a preselected portion of the residual juice by means of a gentle pressing action augmented by centrifugal force. The partially dewatered must is then transferred to one or more final screw presses which apply heavy compression to extract the remainder of usable juice from the predrained must.

fig,4261372,"An electrode in the form of a foil-like flexible, electrically insulating support member having nerve electrodes supported thereupon for implantation into the cochlea. The electrode establishes electrical communication to the acoustic nerves of the human ear, substantially in the area of the cochlea containing the auditory nerves pertaining to that part of the audible spectrum, which is relevant to the intelligibility of speech. The electrode is provided with two prongs and a shank, each prong having a length which corresponds to the length of the turn in the cochlea into which it is to be inserted during implantation and hence the two prongs are of different lengths. Further, each prong terminates in a bevelled pilot guiding member which guides each prong through its respective turn in the cochlea to thereby reduce damage to the auditory nerves. During implantation each prong passes through only a single turn of the cochlea and is prevented from gouging into the walls of the cochlea due to provision of the bevelled guiding member. The guiding member can be provided as a drop-shaped member secured to the end of each prong or by forming an eyelet in the distal ends of the prongs. The present invention is related to an electrode for implantation into the cochlea in order to establish electrical communication to the acoustic nerves of the human ear, the electrode comprising an insulating support member having nerve contact points and associated supply lines. Electrodes of this kind have been described by Martin Sonn and Wolfgang Feist in an article entitled ""A prototype flexible microelectrode array for implant-prosthesis applications"" in Medical and Biological Engineering, Nov. 1974, pages 778-790 and are illustrated in FIG. 1. This prior art electrode is disposed to be inserted through an aperture in a turn of a patient's cochlea, whose internal ear is defective, in order to establish communication substantially in the area of cochlea containing the acoustic nerves pertaining to that part of the audible spectrum, which is relevant to the intelligibility of speech. Accordingly it has such an extension that it has to be introduced into about nearly two turns of cochlea. It has appeared, however, that a satisfactory result was not attained, in as much as it has certainly been possible to bring the patent to such a condition that she or he could interpret electrical signals supplied through the electrode as being sound but not as being intelligible speech. The present invention is based on the opinion that this fact is due to damaging of the patient's acoustic nerves during the insertion of the electrode into the cochlea. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved embodiment of an electrode of the kind discussed above, by means of which the damage of the acoustic nerves during the implantation can be avoided. The present invention is based on the acknowledgement, that the entire area of cochlea which is relevant to speech cannot be contacted collectively, because an electrode having a sufficient extension for this purpose will act unavoidably as a chisel, which during the introduction gouges into cochlea and in this way damages the interior walls of cochlea and possibly the acoustic nerves too. Consequently it would be obvious to implant a number of shorter electrodes, but this will cause difficulties in practice. Partly, implantation of a number of electrodes would last a longer time than it would be permitted to keep the lymph-filled cochlea open and partly the attachment of a number of electrode ends or connection of lines to an external signal source would cause further difficulties compared to application of only a single electrode.",1981-04-14,Electrode for implantation into cochlea,utility,1981,,05959757,05/959757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,inventional] additional,Medical or veterinary science; hygiene] Electric communication technique,"Electrotherapy; magnetotherapy; radiation therapy; ultrasound therapy] Loudspeakers, microphones, gramophone pick-ups or like acoustic electromechanical transducers; deaf-aid sets; public address systems",A61N] H04R,NA,A61N1/0541] H04R25/606,"Electrotherapy; Circuits therefor -Details-Electrodes -for implantation or insertion into the body, e.g. heart electrode -Head electrodes -Cochlear electrodes] Deaf-aid sets ; , i.e. electro-acoustic or electro-mechanical hearing aids; Electric tinnitus maskers providing an auditory perception -Mounting or interconnection of hearing aid parts, e.g. inside tips, housings or to ossicles -of acoustic or vibrational transducers-acting directly on the eardrum, the ossicles or the skull, e.g. mastoid, tooth, maxillary or mandibular bone, or mechanically stimulating the cochlea, e.g. at the oval window",86431] 55331] 6933] 5734,812746] 1062747] 52656] 42834,2an30uk67hbedngnlkno92ua0,86c7ae6802b7c68dced54e872b284112,3,Drgs&Med,32,Surgery & Med Inst.,21688,169001,"An electrode in the form of a foil-like flexible, electrically insulating support member having nerve electrodes supported thereupon for implantation into the cochlea.

The process includes extracting defatted vegetable protein flakes with an aqueous alcohol solution to remove soluble carbohydrates and flavors, leaving an extracted product having a moisture and volatiles content of about 50-70% by weight. The alcohol-extracted product which contains about 20-40% by weight water, is thereafter desolventized in a humid gas atmosphere with a relatively low gas temperature of less than about 260.degree.

corn,4307390,"A seed monitoring apparatus for use with a seed planting machine includes a seed sensor comprising a housing forming a substantially tubular passageway and mounting a light source and three photosensitive elements arranged substantially in a triangular configuration. The arrangement of the light source and the triangular photosensor configuration is such that a seed passing through the tubular passageway will momentarily obscure the passage of light to the photosensor the apex of the triangle, if at all, before obscuring the passage of light to either of the photosensors forming the base of the triangle. The monitoring circuit includes two signal paths in which different methods of counting are used to produce different numbers of pulses in response to signals from the three photosensors.

lettuce,4312152,"A support structure for growing plants such as lettuce by hydroponic cultivation includes a buoyant, closed cell, foamed plastic pallet having an array of spaced integral punch-out plugs arranged preferably in staggered rows.

This means consists of two belts, each running over a bottom pulley rotating together with the respective extractor wheel and over a top pulley mounted at the upper end of the arm, the inner stretches of the two belts being pressed together by two rows of tension pulleys. The stalks are transported to the top between the belts and are released into the gap between a pair of horizontal feed rollers common to both arms and serving to deliver the stalks into the shredder casing through a second pair of feed rollers. The rollers are provided on their outside with ribs and/or teeth so as to firmly grip and transport the plants..

The method must be very accurately carried out to make use of the maximum sugar content of the Jerusalem Artichoke as follows: the Jerusalem Artichoke stalk must be cut above the tubers immediately before the plant flowers to retain all of the sugar in the stalk; the stalk is then ground in a hammermill to release the sugars from the central cylinder, the pith, the ligneous cells, and to a small amount from the bark; the sugar juices from the hammermill are collected; the remaining mass of the central cylinder, pith, ligneous cells and bark is squeezed to remove the remaining sugar juices; the entire collected sugar juice is then processed by 1) bringing the pH to 4.0-4.5, 2) heating to 80.degree.-82.degree.

apple,4466172,"A method for fabricating an integrated circuit semiconductor device comprised of an array of MOSFET elements having self-aligned or self-registered connections with conductive interconnect lines. The method involves the formation on a substrate of a thick oxide insulation layer (30) surrounding openings (99) therein for the MOSFET elements. A gate electrode (38) within each opening is utilized to provide self-registered source (42) and drain (44) regions and is covered on all sides and on its top surface with a gate dielectric layer (46).

apple,4503601,"Disclosed is a manufacturing method of forming silicon gate, self-aligned MOS-type devices having submicron dimensions. After forming the gate from a highly doped polysilicon layer using a mask, the structure is subjected to a low temperature (700-750 degrees C.) thermal oxidation. Due to enhanced oxidation rate of doped silicon surfaces, a very thick oxide layer over the polysilicon gate sidewalls and a relatively thin oxide layer over the source-drain regions of the substrate are formed. The mask over the polysilicon and the oxide layer over the source-drain regions is removed and source-drain implantation is accomplished followed by selective deposition of metal (e.g. tungsten) over the source-drain regions and the polysilicon gate. In an alternative embodiment of this process, after forming the highly doped polysilicon gate using a mask, lightly doped source-drain regions which are self-aligned and in registry with the gate are formed by ion implantation. Then, low temperature thermal oxidation is accomplished growing a thick oxide over the polysilicon gate sidewalls and a thin oxide over the source-drain regions. The mask over the gate and the thin oxide over the source-drain regions is removed and by ion implantation heavily doped source-drain regions are formed in the previously formed lightly doped source-drain regions not masked by the polysilicon sidewall oxide.

After forming the gate from a highly doped polysilicon layer using a mask, the structure is subjected to a low temperature (700-750 degrees C.) thermal oxidation. Due to enhanced oxidation rate of doped silicon surfaces, a very thick oxide layer over the polysilicon gate sidewalls and a relatively thin oxide layer over the source-drain regions of the substrate are formed. The mask over the polysilicon and the oxide layer over the source-drain regions is removed and source-drain implantation is accomplished followed by selective deposition of metal (e.g. tungsten) over the source-drain regions and the polysilicon gate. In an alternative embodiment of this process, after forming the highly doped polysilicon gate using a mask, lightly doped source-drain regions which are self-aligned and in registry with the gate are formed by ion implantation. Then, low temperature thermal oxidation is accomplished growing a thick oxide over the polysilicon gate sidewalls and a thin oxide over the source-drain regions. The mask over the gate and the thin oxide over the source-drain regions is removed and by ion implantation heavily doped source-drain regions are formed in the previously formed lightly doped source-drain regions not masked by the polysilicon sidewall oxide. Selective deposition of a metal is then accomplished over the source-drain regions of the silicon substrate and the polysilicon gate..

canola,4517763,"The process of the present invention provides a convenient route for producing a predetermined hybrid variety of a crop which is capable of undergoing both self-pollination and cross-pollination. Cytoplasmic male sterile plants which also exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance are the key plants for use in the present process. Such cytoplasmic male sterile plants may be readily multiplied and uniformly produced in accordance with the process of the present invention on a relatively economical basis by crossing with suitable maintainer plants. Economical bulk planting of the key plants with either maintainer or restorer plants is made possible. Following cross-pollination from a pollen source which lacks the herbicide tolerance unneeded plants effectively are eliminated by use of a herbicide. For instance, unwanted plants may be effectively eliminated immediately after pollination or prior to pollination in a succeeding generation to make possible the existence in an unharmed state of a substantially homogeneous stand of the desired plants which exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance. The process of the present invention is applicable to grain crops, forage crops, seed propagated fruits, seed propagated ornamentals, and industrial species. In a particularly preferred embodiment a predetermined variety of Brassica napus (i.e., rape or improved forms thereof known as canola) is formed which is the product of cross-pollination.",1985-05-21,Hybridization process utilizing a combination of cytoplasmic male sterility and herbicide tolerance,utility,1985,UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH,06493511,06/493511,NA,NA,NA,CA]

hybrid variety of a crop which is capable of undergoing both self-pollination and cross-pollination. Cytoplasmic male sterile plants which also exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance are the key plants for use in the present process. Such cytoplasmic male sterile plants may be readily multiplied and uniformly produced in accordance with the process of the present invention on a relatively economical basis by crossing with suitable maintainer plants. Economical bulk planting of the key plants with either maintainer or restorer plants is made possible. Following cross-pollination from a pollen source which lacks the herbicide tolerance unneeded plants effectively are eliminated by use of a herbicide. For instance, unwanted plants may be effectively eliminated immediately after pollination or prior to pollination in a succeeding generation to make possible the existence in an unharmed state of a substantially homogeneous stand of the desired plants which exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance. The process of the present invention is applicable to grain crops, forage crops, seed propagated fruits, seed propagated ornamentals, and industrial species.

Cytoplasmic male sterile plants which also exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance are the key plants for use in the present process. Such cytoplasmic male sterile plants may be readily multiplied and uniformly produced in accordance with the process of the present invention on a relatively economical basis by crossing with suitable maintainer plants. Economical bulk planting of the key plants with either maintainer or restorer plants is made possible. Following cross-pollination from a pollen source which lacks the herbicide tolerance unneeded plants effectively are eliminated by use of a herbicide. For instance, unwanted plants may be effectively eliminated immediately after pollination or prior to pollination in a succeeding generation to make possible the existence in an unharmed state of a substantially homogeneous stand of the desired plants which exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance. The process of the present invention is applicable to grain crops, forage crops, seed propagated fruits, seed propagated ornamentals, and industrial species.

provides a convenient route for producing a predetermined hybrid variety of a crop which is capable of undergoing both self-pollination and cross-pollination. Cytoplasmic male sterile plants which also exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance are the key plants for use in the present process. Such cytoplasmic male sterile plants may be readily multiplied and uniformly produced in accordance with the process of the present invention on a relatively economical basis by crossing with suitable maintainer plants. Economical bulk planting of the key plants with either maintainer or restorer plants is made possible. Following cross-pollination from a pollen source which lacks the herbicide tolerance unneeded plants effectively are eliminated by use of a herbicide. For instance, unwanted plants may be effectively eliminated immediately after pollination or prior to pollination in a succeeding generation to make possible the existence in an unharmed state of a substantially homogeneous stand of the desired plants which exhibit cytoplasmic herbicide tolerance. The process of the present invention is applicable to grain crops, forage crops, seed propagated fruits, seed propagated ornamentals, and industrial species. In a particularly preferred embodiment a predetermined variety of Brassica napus (i.e., rape or improved forms thereof known as canola) is formed which is the product of cross-pollination..
