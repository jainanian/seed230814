cauliflower,8138391,"The cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) Or gene is a semi-dominant, single-locus mutation.

Using a map-based cloning strategy, we identified a single candidate gene representing Or and successfully verified its identity by phenotypic complementation in the wild type cauliflower. The Or gene encodes a plastid membrane protein containing the DnaJ zinc figure domain. A likely gain-of-function mutation from a 4.3-kb retrotransposon insertion in the Or allele confers the orange phenotype in the mutant. Southern blot analysis revealed that Or is a single-copy sequence in the cauliflower genome. High level of expression of the Or gene and the protein was found in very young leaves, curds, and flowers at comparable abundance between wild type and the Or mutant. Or likely functions in regulating the differentiation of some non-photosynthetic plastids into chromoplasts, which provide the deposition “sink” for carotenoid accumulation. Or orthologs with high degree of sequence homology were found in many other higher plants, including Arabidopsis, tomato, maize, and rice.

Using a map-based cloning strategy, we identified a single candidate gene representing Or and successfully verified its identity by phenotypic complementation in the wild type cauliflower. The Or gene encodes a plastid membrane protein containing the DnaJ zinc figure domain. A likely gain-of-function mutation from a 4.3-kb retrotransposon insertion in the Or allele confers the orange phenotype in the mutant. Southern blot analysis revealed that Or is a single-copy sequence in the cauliflower genome. High level of expression of the Or gene and the protein was found in very young leaves, curds, and flowers at comparable abundance between wild type and the Or mutant. Or likely functions in regulating the differentiation of some non-photosynthetic plastids into chromoplasts, which provide the deposition “sink” for carotenoid accumulation. Or orthologs with high degree of sequence homology were found in many other higher plants, including Arabidopsis, tomato, maize, and rice.

barley,8178759,Barley with reduced SSII activity has a starch structure with reduced amylopectin content and a consequent high relative amylose content. Additionally the grain can have a relatively high β glucan content. The structure of the starch may also be altered in a number of ways which can be characterized by having a low gelatinzation temperature but with reduced swelling. The viscosity of gelatinized starch of the starch is also reduced. There is a chain length distribution of the amylopectin content and a low crystallinity of the starch. The starch is also characterized by having high levels of lipid associated starch exhibiting very high levels of V form starch crystallinity. The dietary fiber content of the starch is high.
