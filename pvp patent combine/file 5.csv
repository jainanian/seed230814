nut,10098462,"A ready-to-assemble upholstered and non-upholstered chair consisting of factory assembled sub-assemblies reducing the number of overall parts and assembly hardware which decreases the packaged cubic measure allowing more units to be loaded into shipping containers and trailers, inventoried in warehouses and distribution centers and displayed in retail outlets thereby reducing transportation and handling costs, while simplifying and expediting the assembly process. The invention includes a seat box sub-assembly so constructed to allow a portion of the chair back leg sub-assembly to nest therein reducing the package profile and cubic measure, as well as a front leg sub-assembly. The front leg and back leg sub-assemblies are assembled utilizing a left and right tenoned side rail which inserts into mortises on the front and back leg assemblies. The leg sub-assemblies are secured with a metal bolt, threaded on each end, housed longitudinally within a routed channel running on the exterior face of each side rail. The bolt is secured by threading one end into the pre-installed knurled nut in the back leg sub-assembly and a hex socket T-nut and washer on the face of the front leg sub-assembly. The seat box sub-assembly is fitted over the front leg sub-assembly and the left and right side rails and secured on the underside with metal bolts.
