The crystallization of the sodium carbonate is effected by evaporating green liquor with a ratio of hydroxide ions [OH.sup.- ] and sulphide ions [HS.sup.- ] such that the liquor which is obtained after evaporation and separation of the solid phase has high sulphidity and an acceptably low content of carbonate ions [CO.sub.3.sup.2- ]. Prior to evaporation, the hydroxide ion content in the liquor is increased by adding quicklime (CaO). The solid phase (sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate) which has been separated off is diluted with water so that the sodium carbonate crystals go into solution and at the same time the solution is given a cation content which favours the causticization which is subsequently undertaken. The causticization is carried out in a conventional causticization plant. After separating off the lime sludge (CaCo.sub.3) which is formed during the causticization processes, a white liquor of low sulphidity and low carbonate content is obtained for use in the cooking process and, after oxidation, also in the oxygen gas delignification prior to final bleaching of the pulp.",1997-03-04,Process for dividing the sulphide content of the green liquor for the production of white liquors having high and low sulphidity,utility,1997,Kvaerner Pulping Technologies AB,08397253,08/397253,NA,NA,NA,SE] NA,13.5028] NA,59.3809] NA,Karlstad] NA,41] NA,NA,NA,inventional,Paper-making; production of cellulose,Production of cellulose by removing non-cellulose substances from cellulose-containing materials; regeneration of pulping liquors; apparatus therefor,D21C,NA,D21C11/04] D21C11/0078,"Regeneration of pulp liquors ; or effluent waste waters-of alkali lye] Regeneration of pulp liquors ; or effluent waste waters-Aspects concerning the production and the treatment of green and white liquors, e.g. causticizing green liquor-Treatment of green or white liquors with other means or other compounds than gases, e.g. in order to separate solid compounds such as sodium chloride and carbonate from these liquors; Further treatment of these compounds",4253] 1277,24709] 4715,978nb6gpdee1vyl9xisn36h6a] ftu7rlurq3wqjnl06vwqekfkq,968c9325b421773e8a2803f550776a4a,1,Chemical,19,Miscellaneous,49951,378593,"The invention relates to a process for dividing up the sulphide content of green liquor into a sulphide-rich part and a sulphide-poor part by crystallizing out sodium carbonate (Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3).

nut,5609593,"A hook device for use with support rod implantation apparatus, having a rod receiving body polyaxially mounted to a blade portion such that the body may be polyaxially manuevered relative to the blade, for easy rod coupling. The blade portion has a semi-spherical head portion which sits above the lamina. The rod receiving portion is a separate coupling element having lower and upper portions. The lower portion is slotted and tapered, and has a semi-spherical interior chamber in which the semi-spherical head is initially polyaxially disposed. The upper portion has a pair of upwardly extending members, defining therebetween a channel for receiving the rod. The uppermost parts of the upwardly extending members include an threading for receiving a top locking nut. A locking ring is disposed about the coupling element, substantially below the side recess; the top of the coupling element being initially positioned above the lower ledge of the side recess such that the rod, when initially disposed therein, seats against the top surface of the locking ring.

cranberry,5646178,"Compounds isolated from plant materials of the genus Vaccinium, which have biological activity measurable as inhibition with adhesion of bacterial cells to surfaces, are described. The specific compounds include procyanidins, leucocyanin and leucodelphinin, and flavonol glucosides including myricetin-3-pyranoside. An exemplary procyanidin compound is a substituted epicatechin-catechin dimer or other polymer.

nut,5647873,"A polyaxial orthopedic device for use with rod implant apparatus includes a screw having a curvate head, a bicentric locking shell disposed therearound, and a coupling element having a curvate tapered socket into which both the screw and the shell nest. The bicentric shell is slotted and has a semi-spherical interior volume into which the screw head is initially polyaxially held. The coupling element has an axial bore through which the screw and shell may be inserted, and a curvate bottom having a smaller radius of curvature than the shell, which provides a radially inward force on the locking shell when forced thereinto. This radially inward force causes the shell to crush lock against the head of the screw, therein locking the two at the instant angulation. In an initial disposition, however, the screw and the shell head remain polyaxially free with respect to each other, and to the coupling element. The coupling element also includes a transverse channel in which a rod may be disposed. In a first embodiment the channel is formed between a pair of upwardly extending members, and in a second embodiment, the channel is formed in the side of the element. In either case, a rod which is inserted in the channel seats against the top of the shell and the head of the screw.

The coupling element has an axial bore through which the screw and shell may be inserted, and a curvate bottom having a smaller radius of curvature than the shell, which provides a radially inward force on the locking shell when forced thereinto. This radially inward force causes the shell to crush lock against the head of the screw, therein locking the two at the instant angulation. In an initial disposition, however, the screw and the shell head remain polyaxially free with respect to each other, and to the coupling element. The coupling element also includes a transverse channel in which a rod may be disposed. In a first embodiment the channel is formed between a pair of upwardly extending members, and in a second embodiment, the channel is formed in the side of the element. In either case, a rod which is inserted in the channel seats against the top of the shell and the head of the screw. Engagement of a locking nut on the top of the coupling element provides a downward force against the rod, and forces the locking shell into the socket in the bottom of the bore, thereby locking the rod, locking shell, and screw simultaneously..

tobacco,5656474,"Two osmotic stress- and ABA-responsive members of the endochitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) gene family has been isolated and identified from leaves of drought-stressed Lycopersicon chilense plants. The 966-base-pair insert of pcht28 encodes an acidic chitinase precursor with an amino-terminal signal peptide. The mature protein is predicted to have 229 amino acid residues with a relative molecular weight of 24,943 and pI value of 6.2. The same number in amino acids, molecular and PI value are predicted for the protein encoded by pchtI, despite of a slight variation in the DNA and amino acid sequences. Sequence analysis revealed that pcht28 and pchtI have a high degree of homology with class II chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) from tobacco. Northern blot analysis indicated that these genes have evolved a completely different pattern of expression from others reported thus far. They are highly induced by both osmotic stress and the plant hormone abscisic acid. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA suggested that the pcht28- and pchtI-related chitinase is encoded by a small multigene family in this species.

radish,5672251,"The method for producing a metallic wiring board of this invention comprises the steps of: implanting nitrogen on a surface of a substrate; forming a metallic film including, as a main component, one of Ta and Nb on the surface of the substrate where nitrogen is implanted by a sputtering method to form a metallic wiring by patterning the metallic film; and forming an insulating film by anodic oxidation of a surface of the metallic wiring. In the step of forming a metallic wiring form Ta or Nb on a substrate or a protective layer including nitrogen to anodic-oxidize the surface of the metallic wiring, Ta ions or Nb ions do not enter the substrate. Further, the substrate or a protective layer is doped with nitrogen, and a Ta layer is formed by the sputtering method thereon. The sputtering method has a characteristic that a material contained in the substrate is mixed into a film formed in the initial stage of the coating. Therefore, the doped nitrogen enters the Ta film, and a thin .alpha.-Ta layer is formed on the substrate or the protective film.

and forming an insulating film by anodic oxidation of a surface of the metallic wiring. In the step of forming a metallic wiring form Ta or Nb on a substrate or a protective layer including nitrogen to anodic-oxidize the surface of the metallic wiring, Ta ions or Nb ions do not enter the substrate. Further, the substrate or a protective layer is doped with nitrogen, and a Ta layer is formed by the sputtering method thereon. The sputtering method has a characteristic that a material contained in the substrate is mixed into a film formed in the initial stage of the coating. Therefore, the doped nitrogen enters the Ta film, and a thin .alpha.-Ta layer is formed on the substrate or the protective film. The Ta layer to be epitaxially grown thereon is an .alpha.-Ta layer including no impurity. Thus, a Ta layer with a specific resistance of about 25 .mu..OMEGA.cm is obtained..

Through the use of (1) a computer system integrated with (2) automatic individual animal identification (3) multiple measurement and remeasurement systems with automatic data input and (4) a cattle handling and sorting system, animals are individually (a) identified and (b) measured by weight, external dimensions and characteristics of internal body tissue. With this information together with animal physiological characteristics and historical data, the computer system calculated the optimum (c) slaughter weight, (d) economic end point and (e) marketing date for shipment to a packing plant. After measurement, individual animals are (f) sorted by direction of the computer in response to calculations from the measurements. The computer system also calculated from individual animal data and other data (g) each animal's pro rata share of total feed intake for the animal's feed group fed. The computer system (h) stores individual animal measurement, performance and location data, which is used by management to (i) select animals for shipment from the feedlot for slaughter at the optimum time. Following an animal's shipment to a slaughter facility, its identification in the computer system is used to (j) correlate the live animal physical characteristics and performance data to the measured

rice,5736629,"Rice plants are disclosed with two separate, but synergistic mechanisms for resistance to herbicides that normally inhibit a plant's acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) enzyme. The herbicide resistance of plants with both resistance mechanisms is substantially greater than one would expect from a simple combination of the two types of resistance. The first of the two resistance mechanisms is a metabolic pathway that is not fully understood, but that does not itself involve a mutant AHAS enzyme. The second resistance mechanism is a mutant AHAS enzyme, an enzyme that shows direct resistance to levels of herbicide that normally inhibit the enzyme, in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Besides controlling red rice, many AHAS-inhibiting herbicides also effectively control other weeds that are common in rice fields.

The first of the two resistance mechanisms is a metabolic pathway that is not fully understood, but that does not itself involve a mutant AHAS enzyme. The second resistance mechanism is a mutant AHAS enzyme, an enzyme that shows direct resistance to levels of herbicide that normally inhibit the enzyme, in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Besides controlling red rice, many AHAS-inhibiting herbicides also effectively control other weeds that are common in rice fields.

The movement of the cotton in the trough allows sand, dirt and other debris released from the clumps of cotton to pass through the sieve means in the trough. The clumps of cotton removed from the feeder head are introduced into an air separator box where additional contaminants are removed from the dispersed cotton prior to delivery to a cotton gin..
