cotton,8046877,"A seed cotton dryer comprises an array of electromagnetic wave energy generators in a cotton gin and a cotton picker/stripper. An appropriate amount of energy is used to evaporate a considerable amount of moisture in the seed cotton without producing enough energy to pop the cotton seeds. Seed cotton dried by wave energy is much easier to separate the cotton seeds and lint from leaves, stems and other plant parts. The seed cotton is preferably transported through the dryer in a conduit having flat sides which reflects the wave energy more efficiently than through a round conduit. Provisions are made to prevent arcing in the transport conduit when extraneous metal pieces are inadvertently mixed with the seed cotton.

cauliflower,8071841,"The cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) Or gene is a semi-dominant, single-locus mutation. It induces the accumulation of high levels of beta-carotene in various tissues that are normally devoid of carotenoids, turning them orange. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we identified a single gene representing Or and successfully verified its identity by functional complementation in the wild type cauliflower. The Or gene encodes a plastid membrane protein containing the DnaJ zinc figure domain. A likely gain-of-function mutation from a 4.3-kb retrotransposon insertion in the Or allele confers the orange phenotype in the mutant. Southern blot analysis revealed that Or is a single-copy sequence in the cauliflower genome. High level of expression of the Or gene and the protein was found in very young leaves, curds, and flowers at comparable abundance between wild type and the Or mutant.
