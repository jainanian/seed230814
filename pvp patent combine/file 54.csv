The shell and plant are then placed in a transparent enclosure formed from a perforated transparent foil, and the enclosure and a shipping label are then inserted in a shipping container that is at least translucent to enable the plant and the label to be visible therethrough..

rice,8426677,"Novel gibberellin 2-oxidase (GA2ox) genes were identified. Differential expression of GA2ox genes correlated with flower development, seed germination, tiller growth and other developmental processes. In addition, the early and increased growth of tiller and adventitious root and altered root architecture caused by overexpression of GA2oxs further suggest the pleiotropic role of GA2oxs in controlling growth and architecture in plants such as rice. GA2ox5, GA2ox6 and GA2ox9 were three genes encoding class C20 GA2oxs in rice. Mutants or transgenic rice overexpressing class C20 GA2oxs exhibited a broad range of mutant phenotypes, including semi-dwarfism, increased root system and higher tiller numbers that may favor grain yield. Mutations in the conserved domain III were found to affect the physiological activity of class C20 GA2oxs.
