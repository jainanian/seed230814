potato,8569578,"Plant CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) peptides have diverse roles in plant growth and development. We have isolated and characterized the function of five new CLE genes from the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis. Unlike typical plant CLEs that contain a single CLE motif, four of the five Gr-CLE genes encode CLE proteins with multiple CLE motifs. These Gr-CLEs were found to be specifically expressed within the dorsal esophageal gland cell of nematode parasitic stages, suggesting a role for their encoded proteins in plant parasitism. Overexpression of Gr-CLEs in Arabidopsis mimicked overexpression of plant CLEs and Gr-CLE proteins could rescue the Arabidopsis clv3-2 mutant phenotype when expressed within meristems. A short root phenotype was observed when synthetic GrCLE peptides were exogenously applied to roots of Arabidopsis or potato similar to the overexpression of Gr-CLEs in Arabidopsis and potato hairy roots. These results reveal that G. rostochiensis CLEs with either single or multiple CLE motifs function similarly to plant CLEs and that CLE signaling components are conserved in both Arabidopsis and potato roots.

There was an approximately 50% reduction in the average number of cysts per root in the Gr-CLE-1 or Gr-CLE-4 dsRNA transgenic lines when compared with the infected control lines, indicating that silencing nematode CLE genes through host-derived RNAi may generate novel resistance against potato cyst nematodes in transgenic potatoes.",2013-10-29,Generating transgenic potatoes with novel resistance to potato cyst nematodes by silencing nematode parasitism genes of CLE -1 and CLE-4s,utility,2013,"The United States of America, as represented by the Secretary of Agriculture",12847053,12/847053,NA,11] NA,11001] NA,US] NA,-77.0365] NA,38.895] NA,Washington] NA,2423] NA,NA] 10231383] 10246722,NA] Nematode resistant crops] Crop resistance to nematodes,inventional] additional,Organic chemistry] Biochemistry; beer; spirits; wine; vinegar; microbiology; enzymology; mutation or genetic engineering] Technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against climate change,"Peptides] Microorganisms or enzymes; compositions thereof; propagating, preserving, or maintaining microorganisms; mutation or genetic engineering; culture media] Technologies for adaptation to climate change",C07K] C12N] Y02A,NA] 0] 1] 2] 3] 4] 5] 6,C07K14/415] C12N15/113] C12N15/8218] C12N15/8285] C12N2310/14] C12N2310/531] Y02A40/146,"Peptides having more than 20 amino acids; Gastrins; Somatostatins; Melanotropins; Derivatives thereof-from plants] Mutation or genetic engineering; DNA or RNA concerning genetic engineering, vectors, e.g. plasmids, or their isolation, preparation or purification; Use of hosts therefor -Recombinant DNA-technology-DNA or RNA fragments; Modified forms thereof ; Non-coding nucleic acids having a biological activity-Non-coding nucleic acids modulating the expression of genes, e.g. antisense oligonucleotides; Antisense DNA or RNA; Triplex- forming oligonucleotides; Catalytic nucleic acids, e.g. ribozymes; Nucleic acids used in co-suppression or gene silencing] Mutation or genetic engineering; DNA or RNA concerning genetic engineering, vectors, e.g. plasmids, or their isolation, preparation or purification; Use of hosts therefor -Recombinant DNA-technology-Introduction of foreign genetic material using vectors; Vectors; Use of hosts therefor; Regulation of expression-Vectors or expression systems specially adapted for eukaryotic hosts-for plant cells ; , e.g. plant artificial chromosomes (PACs)-Methods for controlling, regulating or enhancing expression of transgenes in plant cells-Antisense, co-suppression, viral induced gene silencing [VIGS], post-transcriptional induced gene silencing [PTGS]] Mutation or genetic engineering; DNA or RNA concerning genetic engineering, vectors, e.g. plasmids, or their isolation, preparation or purification; Use of hosts therefor -Recombinant DNA-technology-Introduction of foreign genetic material using vectors; Vectors; Use of hosts therefor; Regulation of expression-Vectors or expression systems specially adapted for eukaryotic hosts-for plant cells ; , e.g. plant artificial chromosomes (PACs)-Phenotypically and genetically modified plants via recombinant DNA technology-with agronomic (input) traits, e.g. crop yield-for stress resistance, e.g. heavy metal resistance-for biotic stress resistance, pathogen resistance, disease resistance-for nematode resistance] Structure or type of the nucleic acid-Type of nucleic acid-interfering N.A.] Structure or type of the nucleic acid-Physical structure-partially self-complementary or closed-Stem-loop; Hairpin] Adaptation technologies in agriculture, forestry, livestock or agroalimentary production-in agriculture-Genetically Modified [GMO] plants, e.g. transgenic plants",29663] 22479] 59216] 13953] 14990] 12999,391906] 167138] 515783] 109746] 109502] 49585,7cif53w3r72t1vxtjeq48ldbk] en2zw0butkg0xnwt3n71i0wv3,3d1c97c717486d749ec1fa0cccce9847] 41b43fc38f703cd7d239e1d76d949921,3,Drgs&Med,33,Genetics,1692,14925,"Plant CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) peptides have diverse roles in plant growth and development.

potato,8573434,"The present invention overcomes many of the shortcomings inherent in previous containers for packaging potato chips and/or crisps, corn based chips and/or crisps, cookies and the like. The improved implosion-resistant container of the present invention utilizes flowing geometries mechanisms which allow a hermetically sealed container to smoothly change its geometric shape thereby adjusting its internal volume in response to changes in environmental conditions. These volumetric adjustments compensate for changes in environmental conditions thereby avoiding the random buckling and deformation inherent in current packaging techniques which detracts from the commercial presentation of the container. The improved container of the present invention may also include a variety of other stress dissipating mechanisms that counteract the forces causing thermo-plastic container deformation, implosion and loss of seal integrity.
