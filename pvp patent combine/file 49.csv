Pectin methylesterases are economically important enzymes for their impact on quality and processing properties of fruit and vegetable food products. We have now purified TT-PME to homogeneity from sweet orange finisher pulp and determined the complete corresponding nucleic acid sequence. Purified TT-PME was observed by SDS-PAGE as two doublet bands with molecular masses of approximately 46,000 Da and 56,000 Da. Direct Edman sequencing from these proteins showed a common N-terminal peptide. De novo sequencing of eight TT-PME tryptic peptides determined by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry provided additional internal sequences. TT-PME did not correspond to any previously reported Citrus spp. PME sequence. Our results show Citrus TT-PME is a distinctive new isoform with phylogenetic relationship closer to PME isoforms in other species rather than to previously described Citrus PME genes..
