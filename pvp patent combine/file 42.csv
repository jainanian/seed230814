alfalfa,6936708,"Alfin1 cDNA encodes a putative transcription factor associated with salt tolerance in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L). The recombinant protein binds DNA in a sequence specific manner, including promoter fragments of the salt inducible gene MsPRP2. Alfin1 function was tested in transgenic alfalfa under the control of the 35S promoter in the sense and antisense orientations with the endogenous MsPRP2 as a reporter gene. Calli overexpressing Alfin1 were more resistant to growth inhibition by 171 mM NaCl than vector transformed controls, while calli expressing Alfin1 antisense were more sensitive to salt inhibition. Transgenic plants overexpressing Alfin1 in the sense orientation grew well. In contrast, the antisense transgenic plants grew poorly in soil, demonstrating that Alfin1 expression is essential for normal plant development. Transgenic calli and plant roots overexpressing Alfin1 showed enhanced levels of endogenous MsPRP2 mRNA accumalution. However, MsPRP2 mRNA accumulation was also regulated in a tissue specific manner as shown in leaves of transgenics overexpressing Alfin1.

Cultured maize cells have been transformed to constitutively express a barley hemoglobin gene in either the sense (HB+) or antisense (HB−) orientation. Hemoglobin protein in the transformed cell lines was correspondingly higher or lower than in wild type cells under normal atmospheric conditions. Limiting oxygen availability, by placing the cells in a nitrogen atmosphere for 12 hours, had little effect on the energy status of cells constitutively expressing hemoglobin, but had a pronounced effect on both wild type and HB− cells, where ATP levels declined by 27% and 61% respectively. Energy charge was relatively unaffected by the treatment in HB+ and wild type cells, but was reduced from 0.91 to 0.73 in HB− cells suggesting that the latter were incapable of maintaining their energy status under the low oxygen regime. Similar results were observed with P. aeruginosa cells transformed with an Hb expression vector. It is suggested that nonsymbiotic hemoglobins act to maintain the energy status of cells in low oxygen environments and that they accomplish this effect by promoting glycolytic flux through NADH oxidation, resulting in increased substrate level phosphorylation. Nonsymbiotic hemoglobins are likely ancestors of an early form of hemoglobin that sequestered oxygen in low oxygen environments, providing a source of oxygen to oxidize NADH to provide ATP for cell growth and development. This in turn suggests that cells containing increased levels of Hb protein will survive longer under low oxygen tension or high energy demand.",2005-08-30,Nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins to maintain cell energy status,utility,2005,University of Manitoba,09720206,09/720206,NA,NA,NA,CA] NA,-97.7781] NA,54.6237] NA,Cross Lake] NA,176] NA,10039306] 10172380] 10172381] 10314325] 10327464] 10798958] 10863761] 10986848] 10993462] 11013250] 11071315] 11219232] 11224241] 11439166] 8084667] 9011949] 9700067] 9808029] 9826772] 9943096] NA,Methods and compositions for consumables] Ground meat replicas] Methods and compositions for affecting the flavor and aroma profile of consumables] Method of modifying plant phenotypes with nonsymbiotic hemoglobin] NA,additional] inventional,Medical or veterinary science; hygiene] Organic chemistry] Biochemistry; beer; spirits; wine; vinegar; microbiology; enzymology; mutation or genetic engineering] Technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against climate change,"Preparations for medical, dental, or toilet purposes] Peptides] Microorganisms or enzymes; compositions thereof; propagating, preserving, or maintaining microorganisms; mutation or genetic engineering; culture media] Technologies for adaptation to climate change",A61K] C07K] C12N] Y02A,4] 0] 1] 2] 3] 5] NA,A61K35/12] C07K14/415] C07K14/805] C12N1/20] C12N15/8261] Y02A40/146,"Medicinal preparations containing materials or reaction products thereof with undetermined constitution-Materials from mammals; Compositions comprising non-specified tissues or cells; Compositions comprising non-embryonic stem cells; Genetically modified cells] Peptides having more than 20 amino acids; Gastrins; Somatostatins; Melanotropins; Derivatives thereof-from plants] Peptides having more than 20 amino acids; Gastrins; Somatostatins; Melanotropins; Derivatives thereof-Porphyrin- or corrin-ring-containing peptides-Haemoglobins; Myoglobins] Microorganisms, e.g. protozoa; Compositions thereof ; Processes of propagating, maintaining or preserving microorganisms or compositions thereof; Processes of preparing or isolating a composition containing a microorganism; Culture media therefor-Bacteria; Culture media therefor] Mutation or genetic engineering; DNA or RNA concerning genetic engineering, vectors, e.g. plasmids, or their isolation, preparation or purification; Use of hosts therefor -Recombinant DNA-technology-Introduction of foreign genetic material using vectors; Vectors; Use of hosts therefor; Regulation of expression-Vectors or expression systems specially adapted for eukaryotic hosts-for plant cells ; , e.g. plant artificial chromosomes (PACs)-Phenotypically and genetically modified plants via recombinant DNA technology-with agronomic (input) traits, e.g. crop yield] Adaptation technologies in agriculture, forestry, livestock or agroalimentary production-in agriculture-Genetically Modified [GMO] plants, e.g. transgenic plants",86431] 29663] 22479] 59216] 34570] 13953] 14990] 12999,812746] 391906] 167138] 515783] 271804] 109746] 109502] 49585,hdq6rs46vow4ulpd8zbtcfo55] ix7rktw4n7kaap13bqa3xmwwc,e3412e962e62f82664c4d92fedcf75d3,3,Drgs&Med,33,Genetics,1692,14925,"Nonsymbiotic hemoglobins are broadly present across evolution; however, the function of these proteins is unknown.

apple,6936849,"A field-effect transistor (FET) device and method of fabrication uses an electrically interconnected polycrystalline or microcrystalline silicon carbide (SiC) gate having a lower electron affinity and higher work function than a polysilicon gate FET. The smaller threshold voltage magnitude of the SiC gate FET allows reduced power supply voltages (lowering power consumption and facilitating downward scaling of transistor dimensions), and enables higher switching speeds and improved performance. The smaller threshold voltage magnitudes are obtained without ion-implantation, which is particularly useful for SOI and thin film transistor devices. Threshold voltage magnitudes are stable in spite of subsequent thermal processing steps.

tobacco,6965059,"Recent advances of the research on synergistic effect of a mixed baculovirus infection demonstrated the presence of viral molecules enhancing the early event of infection. The enhancins from the Trichoplusia ni was identified to have such a function, i.e., disrupting the structural integrity of peritrophic membrane of midgut of T. ni larva. The enhancin gene was ligated downstream of the CaMV 355 promoter of a binary vector pBI121. With a drug resistant gene, the gene was introduced to a piece of tobacco leaf, from Nicotiana tobacum cv. Havana SR1. We screened 11 regenerated plants out of 37 by feeding tobacco powder mixed in artificial diet, to 3rd instar Pseudaletia separata larvae. The larval stage was usually delayed from 1 to 3 days in comparison of that of control larvae. The larvae did not pupate normally. The larvae showed irregular morphology of half larva and half pupae, suggesting a hormonal disturbance caused by the transgenic tobacco.

apple,6998685,"Off-chip driver (OCD) NMOS transistors with ESD protection are formed by interposing an P-ESD implant between the N+ drain regions of OCD NMOS transistors and the N-well such that the P-ESD surrounds a section of the N-well. The P-ESD implant is dosed less than the N+ source/drain implants but higher than the N-well dose. In another embodiment, N-well doping is used along with P-ESD doping, where the P-ESD doping is chosen such that it counterdopes the N-well underneath the N+ drains. The N-well, however, still maintains electrical connection to the N+ drains. This procedure creates a larger surface under the area where the junction breakdown occurs and an increased radius of curvature of the junction.

apple,7005334,"A zero threshold voltage (ZVt) pFET (104) and a method of making the same. The ZVt pFET is made by implanting a p-type substrate (112) with a retrograde n-well (116) so that a pocket (136) of the p-type substrate material remains adjacent the surface of the substrate. This is accomplished using an n-well mask (168) having a pocket-masking region (184) in the aperture (180) corresponding to the ZVt pFET. The n-well may be formed by first creating a ring-shaped precursor n-well (116′) and then annealing the substrate so as to cause the regions of the lower portion (140′) of the precursor n-well to merge with one another to isolate the pocket of p-type substrate material.
