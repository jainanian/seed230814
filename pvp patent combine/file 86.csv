Wint., the casual agent for the apple scab disease, due to the fact that this new cultivar carries the genetic factor V.sub.f, and closely resembles `Golden Delicious` but differs from `Golden Delicious` in that it is resistant to apple scab, has freedom from stem cavity russet, bears a waxier skin, and green-tinged lenticels at harvest. This new variety of apple tree, now designated as COOP 16, was discovered by applicants in September, 1973, at Lafayette, Ind., in a cultivated area. The tree is a seedling of known parentage planted in 1966 in Block C of the Hinsley Breeding Orchard at the Horticultural Farm of the Purdue University Agricultural Experiment Station, West Lafayette, Ind. In the above orchard, its position was Row 21, Tree 79, having the description PRI 2174-3 in the breeding records.
