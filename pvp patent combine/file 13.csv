soybean,10858704,"Phytoparasitic nematodes that are able to infect and reproduce on plants that are considered resistant are referred to as virulent. The mechanism(s) that virulent nematodes employ to evade or suppress host plant defenses are not well understood. Described herein is the discovery of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reproducibly show allele imbalances between soybean cyst nematode (SCN) grown on resistant and susceptible soybean (Heterodera glycines) plants. Two candidate SCN virulence genes, biotin synthase (HgBioB) and a bacterial-like protein containing a putative SNARE domain (HgSLP-1), were tightly linked to the SNPs. Methods, kits, and compositions are provided for using these discoveries to detect and quantify SCN virulence in field samples.
