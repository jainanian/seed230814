corn,4818770,"DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase; EC 4.1.1.17), strongly retards the growth of several species of phytopathogenic fungi in vitro. Such inhibition can be completely reversed by putrescine or spermidine, confirming the essentiality of polyamines for growth of fungal hyphae. We now have discovered that DFMO can protect a range of plants against a wide range of fungi. For example, DFMO can protect bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris Linnaeus cv. Pinto) against infection by uredospores of the bean rust fungus, Uromyces phaseoli Linnaeus, race O. Unifoliolate leaves of 10-day-old greenhouse-grown seedlings were sprayed with 400 ul per leaf of DFMO at various concentrations in 0.01% Tween 20 at pH 7.0 before or after inoculation with uredospores of Uromyces. After 16 hr in darkness in dew chambers to facilitate spore germination, plants were transferred to the greenhouse, arranged randomly, and examined for local lesions 7 days later. All concentrations of DFMO 0.50 mM or higher gave complete protection against the pathogen; at lower concentrations, postinoculation treatments with DFMO were generally more effective than preinoculation. The appearance of lesions on plants treated with lower concentration of DFMO was retarded 2-6 days. DFMO also confered protection on unsprayed parts of treated plants, indicating the translocation of some protective effect from sprayed areas. DL-alpha-Difluoromethylarginine, an analogous inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase (ADCase; EC 4.1.1.19), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in an alternative pathway for polyamine biosynthesis in higher plants, confers little protection even at 5mM. This emphasizes ornithine decarboxylase as the biochemical locus of choice for the prevention of plant diseases by inhibiting polyamine metabolism. DFMO has also been shown to be an effective synthetic fungicide for the following: protects tomato plants against Verticillium wilt fungus; protects wheat against stem rust fungus; protects wheat against powdery mildew fungus; protects Tendergreen bean plants against powdery mildew fungus; protects the MacIntosh apple leaf against the powdery mildew fungus; protects Ogle oats against leaf rust fungus; and protects corn against the corn rust fungus.",1989-04-04,Prevention of a plant disease by specific inhibition of fungal polyamine biosynthesis,utility,1989,Yale University,06921543,06/921543,NA,09] NA,09009] NA,US] NA,-72.925] NA,41.3082] NA,New Haven] NA,1144] NA,NA,NA,inventional,Agriculture; forestry; animal husbandry; hunting; trapping; fishing,"Preservation of bodies of humans or animals or plants or parts thereof ; biocides, e.g. as disinfectants, as pesticides or as herbicides ; pest repellants or attractants; plant growth regulators",A01N,NA,A01N37/44,"Biocides, pest repellants or attractants, or plant growth regulators containing organic compounds containing a carbon atom having three bonds to hetero atoms with at the most two bonds to halogen, e.g. carboxylic acids -containing at least one carboxylic group or a thio analogue, or a derivative thereof, and a nitrogen atom attached to the same carbon skeleton by a single or double bond, this nitrogen atom not being a member of a derivative or of a thio analogue of a carboxylic group, e.g. amino-carboxylic acids",23008] 6372,149455] 38713,9ai7w3h7oy3tun784jxssg4zb,ba79679645f73c2f974d0436d0d9b5d9,3,Drgs&Med,31,Drugs,29415,266148,"DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase; EC 4.1.1.17), strongly retards the growth of several species of phytopathogenic fungi in vitro.

Unifoliolate leaves of 10-day-old greenhouse-grown seedlings were sprayed with 400 ul per leaf of DFMO at various concentrations in 0.01% Tween 20 at pH 7.0 before or after inoculation with uredospores of Uromyces. After 16 hr in darkness in dew chambers to facilitate spore germination, plants were transferred to the greenhouse, arranged randomly, and examined for local lesions 7 days later. All concentrations of DFMO 0.50 mM or higher gave complete protection against the pathogen; at lower concentrations, postinoculation treatments with DFMO were generally more effective than preinoculation. The appearance of lesions on plants treated with lower concentration of DFMO was retarded 2-6 days.

This emphasizes ornithine decarboxylase as the biochemical locus of choice for the prevention of plant diseases by inhibiting polyamine metabolism. DFMO has also been shown to be an effective synthetic fungicide for the following: protects tomato plants against Verticillium wilt fungus; protects wheat against stem rust fungus; protects wheat against powdery mildew fungus; protects Tendergreen bean plants against powdery mildew fungus; protects the MacIntosh apple leaf against the powdery mildew fungus; protects Ogle oats against leaf rust fungus; and protects corn against the corn rust fungus.",1989-04-04,Prevention of a plant disease by specific inhibition of fungal polyamine biosynthesis,utility,1989,Yale University,06921543,06/921543,NA,09] NA,09009] NA,US] NA,-72.925] NA,41.3082] NA,New Haven] NA,1144] NA,NA] 5198011] 5851537] 6172261] 6646149] 6653351] 7160923] 7208528] RE43327,NA] Methods for inhibiting rust infections of plants] Topical application of .alpha.-DFMO for preventing skin cancer] Polyamine analogues as therapeutic and diagnostic agents] Adjuvant chemotherapy for anaplastic gliomas] Hydrophobic polyamine analogs and methods for their use,inventional,Agriculture; forestry; animal husbandry; hunting; trapping; fishing,"Preservation of bodies of humans or animals or plants or parts thereof ; biocides, e.g. as disinfectants, as pesticides or as herbicides ; pest repellants or attractants; plant growth regulators",A01N,NA] 0,A01N37/44,"Biocides, pest repellants or attractants, or plant growth regulators containing organic compounds containing a carbon atom having three bonds to hetero atoms with at the most two bonds to halogen, e.g. carboxylic acids -containing at least one carboxylic group or a thio analogue, or a derivative thereof, and a nitrogen atom attached to the same carbon skeleton by a single or double bond, this nitrogen atom not being a member of a derivative or of a thio analogue of a carboxylic group, e.g. amino-carboxylic acids",23008] 6372,149455] 38713,9ai7w3h7oy3tun784jxssg4zb,ba79679645f73c2f974d0436d0d9b5d9,3,Drgs&Med,31,Drugs,29415,266148,"DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase; EC 4.1.1.17), strongly retards the growth of several species of phytopathogenic fungi in vitro.

Such inhibition can be completely reversed by putrescine or spermidine, confirming the essentiality of polyamines for growth of fungal hyphae. We now have discovered that DFMO can protect a range of plants against a wide range of fungi. For example, DFMO can protect bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris Linnaeus cv. Pinto) against infection by uredospores of the bean rust fungus, Uromyces phaseoli Linnaeus, race O. Unifoliolate leaves of 10-day-old greenhouse-grown seedlings were sprayed with 400 ul per leaf of DFMO at various concentrations in 0.01% Tween 20 at pH 7.0 before or after inoculation with uredospores of Uromyces. After 16 hr in darkness in dew chambers to facilitate spore germination, plants were transferred to the greenhouse, arranged randomly, and examined for local lesions 7 days later. All concentrations of DFMO 0.50 mM or higher gave complete protection against the pathogen; at lower concentrations, postinoculation treatments with DFMO were generally more effective than preinoculation. The appearance of lesions on plants treated with lower concentration of DFMO was retarded 2-6 days. DFMO also confered protection on unsprayed parts of treated plants, indicating the translocation of some protective effect from sprayed areas. DL-alpha-Difluoromethylarginine, an analogous inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase (ADCase; EC 4.1.1.19), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in an alternative pathway for polyamine biosynthesis in higher plants, confers little protection even at 5mM.

DFMO has also been shown to be an effective synthetic fungicide for the following: protects tomato plants against Verticillium wilt fungus; protects wheat against stem rust fungus; protects wheat against powdery mildew fungus; protects Tendergreen bean plants against powdery mildew fungus; protects the MacIntosh apple leaf against the powdery mildew fungus; protects Ogle oats against leaf rust fungus; and protects corn against the corn rust fungus.",1989-04-04,Prevention of a plant disease by specific inhibition of fungal polyamine biosynthesis,utility,1989,Yale University,06921543,06/921543,NA,09] NA,09009] NA,US] NA,-72.925] NA,41.3082] NA,New Haven] NA,1144] NA,NA] 5198011] 5851537] 6172261] 6646149] 6653351] 7160923] 7208528] RE43327,NA] Methods for inhibiting rust infections of plants] Topical application of .alpha.-DFMO for preventing skin cancer] Polyamine analogues as therapeutic and diagnostic agents] Adjuvant chemotherapy for anaplastic gliomas] Hydrophobic polyamine analogs and methods for their use,inventional,Agriculture; forestry; animal husbandry; hunting; trapping; fishing,"Preservation of bodies of humans or animals or plants or parts thereof ; biocides, e.g. as disinfectants, as pesticides or as herbicides ; pest repellants or attractants; plant growth regulators",A01N,NA] 0,A01N37/44,"Biocides, pest repellants or attractants, or plant growth regulators containing organic compounds containing a carbon atom having three bonds to hetero atoms with at the most two bonds to halogen, e.g. carboxylic acids -containing at least one carboxylic group or a thio analogue, or a derivative thereof, and a nitrogen atom attached to the same carbon skeleton by a single or double bond, this nitrogen atom not being a member of a derivative or of a thio analogue of a carboxylic group, e.g. amino-carboxylic acids",23008] 6372,149455] 38713,9ai7w3h7oy3tun784jxssg4zb,ba79679645f73c2f974d0436d0d9b5d9,3,Drgs&Med,31,Drugs,29415,266148,"DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase; EC 4.1.1.17), strongly retards the growth of several species of phytopathogenic fungi in vitro.

Unifoliolate leaves of 10-day-old greenhouse-grown seedlings were sprayed with 400 ul per leaf of DFMO at various concentrations in 0.01% Tween 20 at pH 7.0 before or after inoculation with uredospores of Uromyces. After 16 hr in darkness in dew chambers to facilitate spore germination, plants were transferred to the greenhouse, arranged randomly, and examined for local lesions 7 days later. All concentrations of DFMO 0.50 mM or higher gave complete protection against the pathogen; at lower concentrations, postinoculation treatments with DFMO were generally more effective than preinoculation. The appearance of lesions on plants treated with lower concentration of DFMO was retarded 2-6 days. DFMO also confered protection on unsprayed parts of treated plants, indicating the translocation of some protective effect from sprayed areas. DL-alpha-Difluoromethylarginine, an analogous inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase (ADCase; EC 4.1.1.19), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in an alternative pathway for polyamine biosynthesis in higher plants, confers little protection even at 5mM. This emphasizes ornithine decarboxylase as the biochemical locus of choice for the prevention of plant diseases by inhibiting polyamine metabolism. DFMO has also been shown to be an effective synthetic fungicide for the following: protects tomato plants against Verticillium wilt fungus; protects wheat against stem rust fungus; protects wheat against powdery mildew fungus; protects Tendergreen bean plants against powdery mildew fungus; protects the MacIntosh apple leaf against the powdery mildew fungus; protects Ogle oats against leaf rust fungus; and protects corn against the corn rust fungus..

This process is also compatible with self-aligned silicide process..

The desirable chemical changes accomplished by the high pressure conditioner include partial denaturization of protein, eliminating or reduction of harmful enzymes and microorganisms, and insolubilizing certain polysaccharides encapsulating the starch in the grains. Such desirable chemical changes lead to better nutritive value of the feed produced. A dryer may also be disposed in flow communication with the system for drying and cooling and rendering stable the conditioned matter for subsequent handling..

In preferred forms, the screws are intermeshed along the majority of the extruder barrel, but diverge at the region of the final frustoconical screw sections and are received within respective complemental barrel sections; in this fashion the material being processed is split into juxtaposed, non-communicating streams, and thereby evenly flows around and supports the adjacent screw section to lessen the tendency of the screws to separate themselves and come into wearing contact with the surrounding barrel walls. The extruder can be used to process a wide variety of plant-derived materials, but is particularly useful for viscous substances (e.g., soy concentrates and isolates) which can be difficult to handle with mono-screw extruders..

nut,4953435,"In an improved trussed neck construction for stringed musical instruments such as guitars, a straight truss rod is disposed in a uniform groove along the rear side of the neck, exposing a surface of the truss along its full length, substantially flush with the rear neck surface. At one end, the truss rod is anchored to the neck, while at the other end it is anchored adjustably to enable correction of unwanted fingerboard curvature, typically concave curvature due to string-tension-induced neck strain. Additional capability is provided to reverse the compensation should this be required, for example to counteract convex fretboard curvature due to neck warpage. The adjustment system, implemented by a machine nut which is adjusted using a wrench, is more rugged than the usual screwdriver system. Adjustment access from the rear of the neck is more convenient than conventional front access. Easy removal of the truss enables field service or replacement without any other disassembly, whereas such removal is difficult or impossible in conventional enclosed truss configurations.

At one end, the truss rod is anchored to the neck, while at the other end it is anchored adjustably to enable correction of unwanted fingerboard curvature, typically concave curvature due to string-tension-induced neck strain. Additional capability is provided to reverse the compensation should this be required, for example to counteract convex fretboard curvature due to neck warpage. The adjustment system, implemented by a machine nut which is adjusted using a wrench, is more rugged than the usual screwdriver system. Adjustment access from the rear of the neck is more convenient than conventional front access. Easy removal of the truss enables field service or replacement without any other disassembly, whereas such removal is difficult or impossible in conventional enclosed truss configurations.

date,4988987,"An electronic lock system is disclosed in which a key can be assigned a limited lifetime, such as by storing data indicative of an expiration date in a key memory. Whenever the key is used with a lock, the lock first examines this key data and verifies that the key is still timely before performing any operations. After a key's expiration date has passed, it is useless until a new expiration date is stored in its memory.

A multi-emitter transistor is therefore provided wherein the emitters can have different betas, the betas being achieved by providing a thicker base width and/or higher doping and thereby a lower beta for the reading emitter, and a thinner base width and/or lower doping, and therefore a higher beta for the standby emitter. The change can be achieved by implanting locally into the region defining the base for the outer or read emitter. Using this high/low beta approach, the implementation of the beta product requirement became much easier..
