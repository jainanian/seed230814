blueberry,PP12165,"A new and distinct low-chill, tetraploid highbush blueberry (Vaccinium) variety of complex ancestry, based largely on V. corymbosum L. with some genes from V. darrowi Camp.

Because `Emerald` is of interspecific origin, it does not correspond to any botanical species, but rather, combines genes from the two species V. corymbosum and V. darrowi. The novelty of the new clone consists of the following unique combination of features: 1. Produces a vigorous, upright plant with high yield potential. 2. Flowers and produces new spring vegetation vigorously in Florida in areas where the mean January temperature is 62.degree. F. or colder. 3. Produces fruit that are large, firm, have a good picking scar, and a good flavor. 4. Can readily be propagated by softwood cuttings under mist. 5.

Has high resistance to cane canker (Botryosphaeria corticis), medium resistance to phytophthora root rot (Phytophthora cinnamomi), and low to medium resistance to stem blight (Botryosphaeria dothidia).3. Flowers and fruits well in areas of central and north Florida where the mean temperature of the coldest month is 57&deg; F. or colder.4. Ripens its fruit 60 days after flowering in north-central Florida (latitude 29.5).5. Ripens 80% of its fruit between April 15 and May 10 in north-central Florida.6. Produces berries that are large, firm, light blue in color, have a good picking scar, and a mild, pleasant, flavor.7. Propagates readily from softwood cuttings..
