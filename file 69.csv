corn,9724667,"The present disclosure provides biorefining systems for co-producing activated carbon along with primary products. A host plant converts a feedstock comprising biomass into primary products and carbon-containing co-products; a modular reactor system pyrolyzes and activates the co-products, to generate activated carbon and pyrolysis off-gas; and an oxidation unit oxidizes the pyrolysis off-gas, generating CO2, H2O, and energy.
