Thrill is a product of a planned breeding program which had the objective of creating new chrysanthemum cultivars for pinched spray pot mum programs having daisy capitulum type, orange red floret color, seven to eight week flowering response and the ability to produce commercially acceptable quality in year round programs. Such traits in combination were not present or required improvements in previously available commercial cultivars. Thrill was originated from a cross made in a controlled breeding program in Salinas, Calif. in 1979. The female parent was an unnamed bronze daisy seedling originated by the present inventor and identified as 781013002. The male parent of Thrill was an unnamed orange daisy spoon seedling originated from a cross between two unnamed seedlings. Thrill was discovered and selected as one flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross by William E. Duffett in September 1980 in a controlled environment in Salinas, Calif. The first act of asexual reproduction of Thrill was accomplished when vegetative cuttings were taken from the initial selection in Nov. 1980 in a controlled environment in Salinas, Calif. by a technician working under formulations established and supervised by William E. Duffett. Horticultural examination of selected units initiated July 15, 1981 has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for Thrill are firmly fixed and are retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. Thrill has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary significantly with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity and day length. The observations, measurements and comparisons describe plants grown in Salinas, Calif. and Leamington, Ontario, Canada under greenhouse conditions which approximate those generally used in commercial practice. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be basic characteristics of Thrill which in combination distinguish this chrysanthemum as a new and distinct cultivar: (1) Flat capitulum form.

The first act of asexual reproduction of Thrill was accomplished when vegetative cuttings were taken from the initial selection in Nov. 1980 in a controlled environment in Salinas, Calif. by a technician working under formulations established and supervised by William E. Duffett. Horticultural examination of selected units initiated July 15, 1981 has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for Thrill are firmly fixed and are retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. Thrill has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary significantly with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity and day length. The observations, measurements and comparisons describe plants grown in Salinas, Calif. and Leamington, Ontario, Canada under greenhouse conditions which approximate those generally used in commercial practice. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be basic characteristics of Thrill which in combination distinguish this chrysanthemum as a new and distinct cultivar: (1) Flat capitulum form. (2) Daisy capitulum type. (3) Orange red ray floret color. (4) Diameter across face of capitulum ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 cm. at maturity. (5) Uniform seven to eight week photoperiodic flowering response to short days. (6) Medium plant height (requiring 2 long day weeks prior to pinch and short days, and 1 to 2 applications of 2500 ppm B-9 SP, the first at 14, the second at 21 days after the beginning of short days to attain a flowered plant height of 25 to 35 cm. in 6"" pots).

Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`, a parent of my new selection has a mature foliage which is a darker green (Spinach Green 0960) with burgundy blotches. Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a looser habit reaching a height of 100 cm in three years. (6) My selection has tolerated cold temperatures to minus 42.degree. F. without a snow cover.

Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`, a parent of my new selection has a mature foliage which is a darker green (Spinach Green 0960) with burgundy blotches. Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a looser habit reaching a height of 100 cm in three years. (6) My selection has tolerated cold temperatures to minus 42.degree. F. without a snow cover.

Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`, a parent of my new selection has a mature foliage which is a darker green (Spinach Green 0960) with burgundy blotches. Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a looser habit reaching a height of 100 cm in three years. (6) My selection has tolerated cold temperatures to minus 42.degree. F. without a snow cover.

Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1).

Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years.

lemon,PP5834,"A new and distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda (Burv.) shrub (popularly known as Spiraea) which shall be referred to hereinafter as Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub. Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`, a parent of my new selection has a mature foliage which is a darker green (Spinach Green 0960) with burgundy blotches. Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a looser habit reaching a height of 100 cm in three years. (6) My selection has tolerated cold temperatures to minus 42.degree. F. without a snow cover.

lemon,PP5834,"A new and distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda (Burv.) shrub (popularly known as Spiraea) which shall be referred to hereinafter as Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub. Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`, a parent of my new selection has a mature foliage which is a darker green (Spinach Green 0960) with burgundy blotches. Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years.

lemon,PP5834,"A new and distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda (Burv.) shrub (popularly known as Spiraea) which shall be referred to hereinafter as Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub. Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`, a parent of my new selection has a mature foliage which is a darker green (Spinach Green 0960) with burgundy blotches. Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a looser habit reaching a height of 100 cm in three years. (6) My selection has tolerated cold temperatures to minus 42.degree. F. without a snow cover.

lemon,PP5834,"A new and distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda (Burv.) shrub (popularly known as Spiraea) which shall be referred to hereinafter as Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub. Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1).

Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red.

spinach,PP5834,"A new and distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda (Burv.) shrub (popularly known as Spiraea) which shall be referred to hereinafter as Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub. Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed. PAC CHARACTERISTICS Spiraea.times.bumalda `Monhub` differs from other selections known to exist by posessing a combination of unique characteristics listed below: (1) The mature foliage color of my new selection is a lemon-green (Scheeles Green 860/1).

Spiraea japonica `Alpina` and S. japonica `Little Princess` when compared to my selection have a darker green foliage that is smaller in size, not at all resembling my new selection. (2) The juvenile foliage on my selection is a yellow tone (Barium Yellow 503/1) with the new foliage exhibiting a russet color (Nasturium Red 14/1). Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has a juvenile foliage which is a lighter shade of green not yellow and the new tips are a red-orange color (Oxblood Red 00823). (3) In colder climates the fall foliage coloring of my new selection is unique. During the early part of autumn the overall foliage color is lemon-green color with interspersed branches of contrasting bright red. By mid-autumn the foliage turns to a salmon russet coloring before the foliage drops completely. (4) The flowers of my selection are a light pink color arranged in flat-topped clusters and flower heavily from mid-spring through summer then sporadically in the fall. Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame` has crimson red flowers and blooms heavily in the summer months. (5) My selection has a dense, compact habit achieving a height of 75 cm in three years.

spinach,PP5834,"A new and distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda (Burv.) shrub (popularly known as Spiraea) which shall be referred to hereinafter as Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub. Spiraea.times.bumalda cultivar Monhub differs from other Spiraeas by a combination of attributes of mature foliage a lemon-green color, juvenile foliage yellow with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, light pink flowers, a dense, compact, uniform growth and a tolerance of temperature to minus 42.degree. F. PAC DISCOVERY This invention relates to a new distinct selection of Spiraea.times.bumalda, a member of the Rose family, Rosaceae. Spiraea.times.bumalda cv. Monhub was a result of direct hybridizing in 1978. The parents are one of my selections hybridized with Spiraea.times.bumalda `Goldflame`. In September of 1979 the selection was made at W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada. The plant to date exists only within the boundaries of W. H. Perron Nursery, Quebec, Canada and Monrovia Nursery Company, Azusa, Calif. This selection has not been offered for sale or described in any publication. PAC REPRODUCTION This new selection has been strictly asexually reproduced by softwood cuttings at W. H. Perron Nursery in order to retain the characteristics of lemon-green mature foliage, yellow juvenile foliage with russet new growth, autumn foliage a salmon russet color, the light pink flowers, the dense compact uniform growth habit and the cold hardiness. Sexual reproduction, such as seed propagation, could result in a potential loss of these selected attributes. Therefore, sexual reproduction is prohibited and propagation is restricted to asexual reproduction by cuttings. Seed progeny from the new selection has not been observed.

lime,PP6330,"A Chrysanthemum plant named Lamplight particularly characterized by its flat capitulum form and single capitulum type, light bronze ray florets, rich yellow mature disc florets, eight week flowering response, and by its excellent flower substance and good keeping quality. The present invention comprises a new and distinct cultivar of Chrysanthemum, botanically known as Chrysanthemum morifolium, Ramat., and referred to by the cultivar name Lamplight. Lamplight is a product of a planned breeding program which had the objective of creating new Chrysanthemum cultivars with an eight week flowering response, bronze color, daisy type flowers, good flower substance, and good keeping quality. Such traits in combination were not present or were in need of improvement in previously available commercial cultivars. Lamplight was originated from a hybridization made by applicant in a controlled breeding program in West Chicago, Ill. in 1980. The female parent was Twilight, a commercially known and patented cultivar. The male parent of Lamplight was Circus, also a commercially known and patented cultivar. Lamplight was discovered and selected as one flowering plant within the progeny of the stated parentage by Peter S. Hesse in November 1981 in a controlled environment in Parrish, Fla. The first act of asexual reproduction of Lamplight was accomplished when vegetative cuttings were taken from the initial selection in February 1982 in a controlled environment in Parrish, Fla. by a technician working under formulations established and supervised by Peter S. Hesse. Horticultural examination of selected units initiated in 1982 has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for Lamplight are firmly fixed and are retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. Lamplight has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary significantly with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity and day length. The following observations, measurements and comparisons describe plants grown in Parrish, Fla. under greenhouse conditions which approximate those generally used in commercial practice. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be basic characteristics of Lamplight, which in combination distinguish this Chrysanthemum as a new and distinct cultivar: 1. Eight week response period. 2. Flat capitulum form, single capitulum type. 3. Butterscotch bronze color of ray florets. 4. The under surface of the ray florets is a bicolored golden yellow/butterscotch. 5. Disc florets are a rich yellow when mature, shedding little pollen; immature disc florets are lime green. 6. Capitulum 5 to 6 cm across; mature ray florets 18-22 mm long, 10 mm across, approximately 21 ray florets per flower. 7. Each plant produces 4-5 breaks after pinching. 8. Leaves are of medium size, up to 110 mm long and 70 mm wide. 9. Plant is of medium height, growing approximately 30 cm above the edge of the pot when grown under a normal pot mum program. 10. Excellent flower substance and good keeping quality. Of the many commercial cultivars known to the present inventor, the most similar in comparison to Lamplight are Candlelight and Cirbronze. Reference is made to attached Chart A which compares certain characteristics of Lamplight to those same characteristics of Cirbronze. Compared to Cirbronze, Lamplight has slightly smaller flowers, fewer ray florets, a lighter flower color, and a slightly more vigorous growth habit.

The present invention comprises a new and distinct cultivar of Chrysanthemum, botanically known as Chrysanthemum morifolium, Ramat., and referred to by the cultivar name Lamplight. Lamplight is a product of a planned breeding program which had the objective of creating new Chrysanthemum cultivars with an eight week flowering response, bronze color, daisy type flowers, good flower substance, and good keeping quality. Such traits in combination were not present or were in need of improvement in previously available commercial cultivars. Lamplight was originated from a hybridization made by applicant in a controlled breeding program in West Chicago, Ill. in 1980. The female parent was Twilight, a commercially known and patented cultivar. The male parent of Lamplight was Circus, also a commercially known and patented cultivar. Lamplight was discovered and selected as one flowering plant within the progeny of the stated parentage by Peter S. Hesse in November 1981 in a controlled environment in Parrish, Fla. The first act of asexual reproduction of Lamplight was accomplished when vegetative cuttings were taken from the initial selection in February 1982 in a controlled environment in Parrish, Fla. by a technician working under formulations established and supervised by Peter S. Hesse. Horticultural examination of selected units initiated in 1982 has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for Lamplight are firmly fixed and are retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction.
