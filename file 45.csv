date,7228341,"A method for facilitating the electronic scheduling for playback of a variety of media such as music or video is disclosed. In the described system, discrete items of content (such as music or video) are scheduled for play back based upon a schedule created by the integration of five standard scheduling methods into a single comprehensive scheduling algorithm. In the first scheduling method a discrete item of content is assigned a frequency rating relative to other items of content. A second way to schedule is called recurring playback. In the recurring method, a particular item of content is scheduled to repeat at specific intervals of time. Intervals can be in terms of minutes, hours or days. A third scheduling method allows the content to be played according to a time base, that is, media content can be scheduled to play at a specific date and time. The forth type of input to the scheduling system is a trigger event which is received from a source external to the scheduling system. Upon receiving a trigger event, particular media content will be played. This type of input includes a mechanism called asynchronous request and relates to play of previously unscheduled content on an external request basis.

In the described system, discrete items of content (such as music or video) are scheduled for play back based upon a schedule created by the integration of five standard scheduling methods into a single comprehensive scheduling algorithm. In the first scheduling method a discrete item of content is assigned a frequency rating relative to other items of content. A second way to schedule is called recurring playback. In the recurring method, a particular item of content is scheduled to repeat at specific intervals of time. Intervals can be in terms of minutes, hours or days. A third scheduling method allows the content to be played according to a time base, that is, media content can be scheduled to play at a specific date and time. The forth type of input to the scheduling system is a trigger event which is received from a source external to the scheduling system. Upon receiving a trigger event, particular media content will be played. This type of input includes a mechanism called asynchronous request and relates to play of previously unscheduled content on an external request basis. And lastly, means are provided for selectively determining whether or not particular content is available for play in a particular venue or during a particular period of time.

lime,7279039,"A method and apparatus for reducing air pollutants associated with dry process, precalciner cement manufacturing is shown. Raw feed meal used in cement production is heated in a special heating chamber to drive off volatile compounds, such as organic materials and salts of ammonia. Preferably, the feed meal is heated to a temperature of at least 350° F. The gases that are driven off flow to the precalciner where they are combusted and rendered harmless. Heat is provided by diverting at least a portion of the exhaust gases from the cement pyroprocessing kiln to the special heater. The raw feed meal is indirectly heated using a heat exchange wall between the feed meal and the kiln exhaust gas flow. In addition, abase-containing material such as lime or precalcined feed meal, may be added to the raw feed before treatment meal to promote the breakdown of inorganic ammonium compounds, thereby releasing gaseous ammonia which is also destroyed upon subsequent combustion.

With effective residual activity against red rice and other weeds, rice producers now have a weed control system superior to those that are currently available commercially..
