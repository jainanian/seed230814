The process improves the agronomic performance of crop plants by using genetic material that is also used in classical breeding. Instead of sexually recombining entire genomes at random, as is done in classical breeding, specific genetic elements are rearranged in vitro and inserted back into individual plant cells. Plants obtained through this new plant breeding process do not contain foreign nucleic acid but only contain nucleic acid from the plant species selected for transformation or plants that are sexually compatible with the selected plant species. Plants developed through this new plant breeding process are provided. In particular, potato plants displaying improved tuber storage and health characteristics are provided..

tobacco,7901691,A novel chimeric protein of rabies virus designed to express a chimeric G protein at a high level in transgenic plants. A gene was also designed and chemically synthesised to encode the chimeric G protein and expressed at high level in plant tissue. The gene was expressed in transgenic tobacco plants to examine its therapeutic efficacy against infection by rabies virus. The chimeric G protein was enriched in plant membranes. The BalbC mice were immunised with the plant leaf expressed G-protein. Plant derived chimeric G protein elicited higher immune response as compared to the commercial vaccine. The mice displayed protective immunity when they were challenged with live virus.

nonvolatile random access memories (NVRAM), tunable dielectrics for multi layer ceramic capacitors (MLCC), infrared sensors and electro-optic modulators. The structure is formed by depositing alternating layers of barium titanate and barium zirconate by ALD on a substrate surface using precursor chemicals, and repeating to form a sequentially deposited interleaved structure of desired thickness and composition. Such a layer may be used as the gate insulator of a MOSFET, or as a capacitor dielectric. The properties of the dielectric may be tuned by adjusting the percentage of zirconium to titanium to optimize properties such as a dielectric constant, Curie point, film polarization, ferroelectric property and a desired relaxor response..
